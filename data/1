00:00:34,814 --> 00:00:38,365
(man) <i>Less than one percent of
the population is psychopathic.</i>

3
00:00:38,398 --> 00:00:41,791
<i>Psychopaths often
inherit the trait</i>

4
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:44,446
<i>and are incapable of love.</i>

5
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:48,383
<i>They manage their relationships
with clinical precision,</i>

6
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:51,805
<i>succeeding
in all walks of life.</i>

7
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:56,095
<i>Psychopaths that can learn
to love are even more rare.</i>

8
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:59,199
<i>As rare as a black swan.</i>

9
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:01,887
It's time.

10
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,695
I'm not dead yet.

11
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:11,134
Naming a successor is a sign of
strength, not weakness, Father.

12
00:01:11,166 --> 00:01:13,407
You've always had more ambition
than your brother.

13
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,550
(woman) <i>Olly is more ambitious
than you think.</i>

14
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:19,167
(man) There's a difference
between ambition and pride.

15
00:01:19,199 --> 00:01:20,734
He's just trying to impress you.

16
00:01:20,766 --> 00:01:24,094
Well, no matter how hard
your brother tries,

17
00:01:24,127 --> 00:01:26,014
<i>he'll always be replaceable.</i>

18
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:27,999
(woman) <i>Boy, does he know
you feel that way.</i>

19
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,158
I don't care,
and neither should you.

20
00:02:08,223 --> 00:02:11,134
(Olly) Last one of the day,
boys. Let's light her up.

21
00:02:12,798 --> 00:02:14,815
Stay professional.

22
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:26,141
- Morning.
- Was when I got here.

23
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:28,798
- What did you offer 'em?
- Fifty fucking grand.

24
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:30,718
Well, that's twice
what you paid for the delay.

25
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,031
Yeah, I already paid 'em
a hundred.

26
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:33,343
Pissed it away
on whores and vodka.

27
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,134
Yeah, well, do you blame 'em?

28
00:02:35,167 --> 00:02:38,815
No. I mean, I wouldn't wanna
live in that fucking shithole.

29
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:40,381
Well, they want more money.

30
00:02:40,414 --> 00:02:42,943
Clearly. Alright,
increase the offer,

31
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:46,078
but if it goes noisy,
that's what you're here for.

32
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,230
Grace.

33
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,247
What's a fair price
for that village?

34
00:02:54,495 --> 00:02:56,605
Two hundred?

35
00:02:56,638 --> 00:03:01,887
OK, well, if they refuse,
cut their tongues out.

36
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:03,294
(chuckles)

37
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:06,495
- Is she capable of that?
- Of course.

38
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:08,734
Well, if she fucks it up,
it's down to you.

39
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,743
I just need that village
cleared today, alright?

40
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:15,167
Hey, Pop, is it unprofessional
to burn him?

41
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:20,605
My God, Olly. You really do
have shit for brains.

42
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:43,359
(dogs bark)

43
00:03:57,502 --> 00:03:59,455
Enemy front!

44
00:04:03,262 --> 00:04:04,959
(woman screams)

45
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:08,383
(man shouts)

46
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,494
(yells)

47
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:13,565
Go, go, go! Go. Up the hill.

48
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,325
(men shouting)

49
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:24,159
(man over radio) <i>Switch fire
right. Switch fire right. Out.</i>

50
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,845
- Oh, it's just a scratch.
- (groans)

51
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:28,351
You're good.

52
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:32,254
(men shouting)

53
00:04:42,847 --> 00:04:45,246
(gunfire continues)

54
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:55,102
They don't want money.

55
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:57,278
They want a fight.

56
00:04:58,334 --> 00:05:00,991
Make a decision. Make it now.

57
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,502
Kill the men and the boys,

58
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:07,743
and leave the women
to spread the fear.

59
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,695
(gunshot)

60
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:26,686
(gunshot)

61
00:05:26,718 --> 00:05:29,662
(screaming)

62
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:45,247
(screams)

63
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:49,535
(shouting)

64
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,869
(screaming)

65
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:00,670
Welcome home, Thomas.

66
00:07:00,702 --> 00:07:03,038
Great to see you, Callum.
Looking good as always.

67
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,542
You staying for Christmas?

68
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:06,430
I just came
to pick something up.

69
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:09,150
That's my job. Tell me what you
need. I'll organize some tea.

70
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:13,502
Thanks, but I'd rather do it
myself. It's in Nanna's box.

71
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:17,151
- Well, that is a surprise.
- To me as well.

72
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,775
Be nice to have some laughter
in the house.

73
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,151
(Thomas) Early days.

74
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:23,263
I plan to keep my flat
but weekend here.

75
00:07:23,294 --> 00:07:24,927
If Sophie fancies it.

76
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:28,671
Will she be needing
color charts for the nursery?

77
00:07:28,702 --> 00:07:29,950
You're worse than my mother.

78
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,903
She would have been proud.

79
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:33,375
Somehow I doubt that.

80
00:07:33,406 --> 00:07:35,039
Thomas, your parents were...

81
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:37,150
My parents
were wildly disappointed in me.

82
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:39,966
Your nanna would have approved.

83
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:41,374
Did you fix the windows
in her library?

84
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:42,975
All done, sir.

85
00:07:43,006 --> 00:07:46,047
We also planted
another 40 acres of oak.

86
00:07:46,078 --> 00:07:47,230
Her favorite.

87
00:07:47,263 --> 00:07:49,566
That would be you, sir.

88
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:52,958
- Thank you, Callum.
- Of course, sir.

89
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:44,159
Having second thoughts?

90
00:08:45,406 --> 00:08:46,591
Never.

91
00:08:46,622 --> 00:08:48,959
What is it, then?

92
00:08:53,886 --> 00:08:55,966
Did Nanna really love Grandpa?

93
00:08:56,766 --> 00:08:58,270
In her own way.

94
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:02,622
Could you be any more obtuse?

95
00:09:02,655 --> 00:09:05,022
She had a special way
of seeing the world,

96
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:07,422
including your grandfather.

97
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:09,790
For her, it was love.

98
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,607
You understand?

99
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,191
Beginning to.

100
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,006
That's why she wanted you
to have that ring.

101
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:20,766
The great Henry Buckingham

102
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:22,750
chopped it off
the maharaja's finger

103
00:09:22,782 --> 00:09:24,479
during the Indian Mutiny

104
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,646
and bequeathed it to her
upon his passing.

105
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:31,486
So the story goes.

106
00:09:31,518 --> 00:09:33,406
Your nanna did keep her secrets.

107
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,070
Guess we'll never know
the truth.

108
00:09:39,102 --> 00:09:41,726
I know she would be pleased.

109
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,310
Sophie is a fine choice, Thomas.

110
00:09:47,582 --> 00:09:48,991
Then it's time.

111
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,558
(man) <i>This just in
from our sources.</i>

112
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,254
Red Notices have been issued

113
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:58,718
for three members
of the notorious Black Swans,

114
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,086
a family-owned
private military company

115
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,999
linked to alleged atrocities
in the Republic of Georgia.

116
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,110
The three are Americans
William Lewis

117
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:08,895
and his adult children,
Grace and Oliver Lewis.

118
00:10:08,926 --> 00:10:11,262
The family is reported
to be living in North London.

119
00:10:11,294 --> 00:10:13,150
They're accused
of crimes against humanity

120
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:16,479
following an alleged massacre
that has only now come to light.

121
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,495
<i>The remote area
where it happened</i>

122
00:10:18,526 --> 00:10:21,694
<i>is known as a corridor for
transnational gas pipelines.</i>

123
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:24,222
<i>The International
Criminal Court is demanding</i>

124
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:26,527
<i>that the UK extradite
the accused to the Hague</i>

125
00:10:26,558 --> 00:10:28,126
<i>where they will stand trial.</i>

126
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:29,854
<i>The prime minister's office
has so far</i>

127
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:31,678
<i>refused to comment
on the Red Notices</i>

128
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,630
<i>or whether it plans
to serve them,</i>

129
00:10:33,662 --> 00:10:36,670
<i>but we're waiting for further
updates from Number Ten.</i>

130
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,871
<i>(gunfire and screaming
on video)</i>

131
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,854
It wasn't
what we hired him to do.

132
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,326
Doesn't matter.

133
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:58,782
He stands trial,
Lewis will say we sanctioned it.

134
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:01,790
Well, you're PM.
What do you wanna do?

135
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:05,566
I mean, we could kick him
into the long grass.

136
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,446
You could do. But you do know
this is not gonna blow over?

137
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:10,783
Mercenaries have been tearing
the arse out of it for decades.

138
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:13,918
They may have done, but now
every fucker has a mobile phone.

139
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,062
- Fair one.
- We could deport him.

140
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,142
No. The Yanks
won't eat our shit.

141
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:20,766
Lewis lives here.
He does his business here.

142
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:22,782
He's been here
for 40 years or so.

143
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:24,478
He's just bought
the Habsburg House.

144
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,886
- What, in Hampstead Heath?
- Yeah.

145
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:27,775
Clearly we're paying him
too much.

146
00:11:27,806 --> 00:11:29,695
Well, keeping our hands clean
is a pricey business.

147
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:31,903
And at that price, I expect them
to be washed of this shite.

148
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:34,270
There is a difference
between disavowing Lewis

149
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:36,030
and serving him
with a Red Notice.

150
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,598
He will expect
a level of protection.

151
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:41,503
No. I cannot be seen
to protect a war criminal.

152
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,774
So do you want me to go round
his house and arrest him?

153
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:46,590
No, I never said anything
about an arrest.

154
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:50,974
Lewis will have prepared
for that too.

155
00:11:51,006 --> 00:11:52,638
There's a reason we hired him
in the first place.

156
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,878
And there's a reason
I hired you.

157
00:12:06,238 --> 00:12:07,646
Natalie, can I grab those notes?

158
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:09,214
Yes, Doctor.

159
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:10,239
- Thank you.
- There you go.

160
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,126
- Hi, Dr Hart.
- Hi.

161
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:18,655
Surprise.

162
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,102
- Surprise?
- First-class ticket to Paris.

163
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:25,278
Flight's at 1:30 tomorrow.

164
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,078
Tom, that's lovely, but...

165
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,214
I rang Dr. Wells.
She agreed to take your shifts.

166
00:12:33,247 --> 00:12:34,975
I haven't spoken to you
in three weeks,

167
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:36,734
and the first person you call
is my consultant

168
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:37,822
to change my schedule?

169
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:41,758
- Yeah.
- Tom, that's not OK.

170
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,390
You've been dying
to go to Paris.

171
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:44,767
I've been dying
to spend some time with you.

172
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,326
Good thing
we're going together, then.

173
00:12:51,134 --> 00:12:54,238
Tom, stop.

174
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,670
I'm sorry.
Gotta sort something at work.

175
00:12:56,702 --> 00:12:58,846
- But you just got back.
- It won't take long.

176
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,830
I've heard that one before.

177
00:13:00,862 --> 00:13:02,718
It'll be alright.

178
00:13:03,838 --> 00:13:05,919
Meet you at the airport.

179
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,174
- I haven't said yes yet.
- Don't be late.

180
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:12,671
Silly fucker.

181
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:16,158
Hi, James. How's your leg today?

182
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,478
(chatter)

183
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,974
I need everyone out. Now.

184
00:13:39,006 --> 00:13:42,014
(Olly) Yeah, come on,
everyone out. Let's go.

185
00:13:44,766 --> 00:13:45,726
(Grace sighs)

186
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,942
I just got a message.

187
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:49,438
The SAS is about to move on us.

188
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,230
We can book a G4
out of Farnborough,

189
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:57,502
fly home,
take our chances there.

190
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,286
England is home.

191
00:14:00,318 --> 00:14:05,503
Dad. After all these years,
you're still not one of them.

192
00:14:05,535 --> 00:14:08,670
- Never will be.
- Well, that's true.

193
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:11,678
I'm one of me. So are you.

194
00:14:13,822 --> 00:14:17,534
Clements was just
using us anyway.

195
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:21,406
No. I've been using him
for my own means.

196
00:14:21,438 --> 00:14:25,118
This government is addicted
to what we do for them.

197
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,702
In three to four hours, they're
gonna break down that door

198
00:14:32,734 --> 00:14:34,046
and they are gonna arrest us.

199
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:36,606
The last thing they want
is an arrest.

200
00:14:36,638 --> 00:14:40,031
If I'd seen that girl
with the phone...

201
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:43,390
- Next time.
- (sighs)

202
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:46,559
There won't be one
unless we do something now.

203
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:50,206
What would you have us do?

204
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:53,790
Enact the safeguard.

205
00:14:54,846 --> 00:14:56,766
Big job.

206
00:14:56,798 --> 00:14:59,486
Simulated it six times.

207
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:02,461
Casualties always
a hundred percent.

208
00:15:04,831 --> 00:15:06,943
We're about to get shot
in the back.

209
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:10,174
Anything else from here
is a bonus.

210
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,918
(Grace sighs)

211
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:21,982
OK.

212
00:15:40,447 --> 00:15:42,303
Are those pansies?

213
00:15:43,998 --> 00:15:45,310
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

214
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:48,734
I'm with the Heath
and Hampstead Society.

215
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:50,143
Each year
we select one household

216
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:51,614
with the finest winter blossoms

217
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:52,831
and feature it on our website.

218
00:15:52,863 --> 00:15:54,590
Thanks,
but we're not interested.

219
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:58,366
That's a shame. You've done
such a brilliant job.

220
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:01,407
I'm gonna have to ask you
to leave. I'm a bit tired.

221
00:16:03,934 --> 00:16:08,030
Are the pansies
more fragrant to you?

222
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:10,207
No, not really. Why?

223
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,223
Some women develop
a better sense of smell

224
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:13,726
when they're pregnant.

225
00:16:13,757 --> 00:16:16,350
That's something
to look forward to.

226
00:16:16,381 --> 00:16:19,261
- If you don't mind...
- How many months are you?

227
00:16:19,775 --> 00:16:21,470
Six.

228
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,294
Boy or a girl?

229
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:25,439
They can't tell yet.

230
00:16:30,814 --> 00:16:33,151
You can determine the sex
of a child at three months.

231
00:16:33,183 --> 00:16:36,670
And they're primroses.
Not pansies.

232
00:16:43,807 --> 00:16:45,823
Red 1. I'm compromised out here.

233
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:48,126
- Sitrep on the woman.
- <i>Neutralized.</i>

234
00:16:48,158 --> 00:16:50,046
- What about the baby?
- No baby.

235
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,046
Just a fake belly rig
concealing an automatic short.

236
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:58,814
- Olivia, who is she?
- She works security for Lewis.

237
00:16:58,846 --> 00:17:02,717
There's a 76% probability
that he is on target.

238
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:04,894
OK.

239
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:07,326
Alpha. To confirm,
this is a hard arrest

240
00:17:07,358 --> 00:17:10,045
on a William Lewis
and known associates,

241
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:11,551
aka the Black Swans,

242
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:16,191
under Red Notice 790274
for crimes against humanity.

243
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:17,821
(Tom) <i>Confirmed.</i>

244
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:19,390
There will be no threat
to their life or reason.

245
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:21,694
You will serve the Red Notice
using nonlethal means.

246
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:23,871
- <i>Confirmed.</i>
- Stop fucking about.

247
00:17:23,903 --> 00:17:25,566
Red Notice calls for
a hard arrestment.

248
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:26,847
The moment you make contact,

249
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,671
you will fight
and you will kill him.

250
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:30,238
This is London, not Londonderry.

251
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,254
Enemy front. Enemy front.

252
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:36,447
<i>All call signs, this is Alpha.
I have control. Go, go, go.</i>

253
00:17:36,479 --> 00:17:38,494
There you go, mate.
That's yours.

254
00:17:43,774 --> 00:17:44,861
Coming through.

255
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:47,550
Smoke. Get the smoke down now.

256
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:54,751
<i>Red 6. Man down. Man down.</i>

257
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:58,334
<i>Alpha. Roger that.
My call sign moving now.</i>

258
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,310
Cover.

259
00:18:17,341 --> 00:18:19,230
Oh, fuck that.

260
00:18:21,694 --> 00:18:23,679
Sierra 1. I had to take it.

261
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,021
<i>Alpha.</i>

262
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:28,447
<i>Red 7. Held at the rear.</i>

263
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,638
<i>Cannot make entry.
I say again: cannot make entry.</i>

264
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,758
Fuck it.

265
00:18:38,014 --> 00:18:40,446
Come on, mate. Smash it.

266
00:18:42,879 --> 00:18:43,807
Come on.

267
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,214
Oh, shit.

268
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,287
Red 1. Need door entry.

269
00:18:48,318 --> 00:18:50,238
Alpha. Roger that.

270
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:52,734
Red 3. Moving now.

271
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,143
Clear!

272
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,543
- (gun clicks)
- Stoppage! Stoppage!

273
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:18,399
- Clear!
- Up.

274
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:25,918
<i>That's Red 9.
Checking the garage. Out.</i>

275
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:36,990
Don't move! Don't move!

276
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:50,815
Lewis confirmed. Dining room.

277
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:53,023
Any eyes on Grace?

278
00:19:53,054 --> 00:19:54,718
(Tom) Unsighted.

279
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,502
<i>Sierra 1. I've got movement
on the ground floor.</i>

280
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:01,054
(commander)
<i>Red 1. Check it. Out.</i>

281
00:20:01,085 --> 00:20:05,022
<i>Sierra 1.
That's moving up the stairwell.</i>

282
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:06,781
<i>Now unsighted.</i>

283
00:20:06,814 --> 00:20:08,287
<i>(footsteps on stairs)</i>

284
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,959
Just in time for lunch.

285
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,038
Where's Grace?

286
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:34,143
Upstairs. Getting dressed.

287
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,223
Oi.

288
00:20:36,254 --> 00:20:38,591
Fuck off and do your job.

289
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,847
Roger that.

290
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:58,207
Wow.
It's like a fucking museum.

291
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:02,718
I needed somewhere to put my
stuff. It's been a busy life.

292
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:06,910
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I've got tons of this shit.

293
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,375
I'm still going.

294
00:21:09,407 --> 00:21:11,327
And you're about to stop.

295
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,845
Tom, man on! Man on!

296
00:21:24,927 --> 00:21:27,551
Stitched up
by a kid with a mobile.

297
00:21:27,582 --> 00:21:29,823
Thank fuck they didn't have 'em
in Rhodesia.

298
00:21:29,854 --> 00:21:32,671
(chuckles)

299
00:21:32,703 --> 00:21:35,391
- Good skills on this job.
- Thank you.

300
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:38,142
Word has it
that Grace did the sniping.

301
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,095
Tell 'em that I did that.

302
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:43,742
If Grace sticks with that story,
I'll ensure she's looked after.

303
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:45,791
What, by the PM?

304
00:21:45,822 --> 00:21:50,686
Politicians come and go, mate.
I'm the consistency.

305
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:54,814
Grace is...

306
00:21:57,406 --> 00:21:58,974
Grace is good value.

307
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:02,398
Every father
loves their daughter.

308
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:05,822
I've never loved anybody
in my life.

309
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,855
But Grace is special.

310
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:11,806
In what way?

311
00:22:11,838 --> 00:22:15,455
Well, she's like me.
Only better.

312
00:22:23,743 --> 00:22:27,102
(Clements) <i>Grace isn't joining
us for lunch, is she, Lewis?</i>

313
00:22:27,135 --> 00:22:29,247
(Lewis) <i>You're gonna miss me,
George.</i>

314
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:31,423
(Clements) <i>I'm not gonna miss
cleaning up your mess.</i>

315
00:22:31,454 --> 00:22:33,822
If you could do it
with peace, love

316
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:36,862
and a steak dinner, you would.

317
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:40,831
Everyone is replaceable.
Even a Black Swan.

318
00:22:48,415 --> 00:22:49,598
(gunshots)

319
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,886
- Stand still! Stand still!
- Stand still! Stand still!

320
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,062
(Tom) Turn! Show your face!

321
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:06,302
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you!

322
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,767
Grenade!

323
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,039
(groans)

324
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,215
(laughs)

325
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:18,367
Fuck.

326
00:23:21,022 --> 00:23:23,871
- You alright, mate?
- Oh, yeah, living the dream.

327
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,535
Oh, shit.

328
00:23:32,446 --> 00:23:34,046
Oh, cheers, mate.

329
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,190
Ooh. Your jacket's ruined.

330
00:23:36,222 --> 00:23:39,839
What you gonna wear
for grouse hunting this year?

331
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,311
Fuck off.

332
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,719
You were supposed to use
nonlethal means.

333
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,575
Didn't have a choice.

334
00:23:48,606 --> 00:23:51,967
He's right, boss. Target had
a grenade. Pulled the pin on us.

335
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:54,622
Oh. Was that before or after
Tom shot her in the face?

336
00:23:54,655 --> 00:23:57,694
- Nasal spine, actually.
- Ha. Ha-ha-ha.

337
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,647
And how do you expect me
to sell that up the food chain,

338
00:23:59,678 --> 00:24:01,182
let alone the <i>Guardian?</i>

339
00:24:01,215 --> 00:24:03,039
And she looked nothing
like Grace Lewis.

340
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:04,959
- What?
- The woman. The one I shot.

341
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,782
Nothing like her.

342
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:09,055
We cordoned off the residence
an hour prior to the raid.

343
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:10,846
(man) Everest 1
was drawing us in there.

344
00:24:10,878 --> 00:24:12,831
Giving Grace time to escape.

345
00:24:12,862 --> 00:24:15,486
OK, well,
I'll issue an all-ports warning.

346
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:17,631
But this is why you're supposed
to use nonlethal means,

347
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:19,807
so whoever it is
that we're looking for

348
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:20,863
ends up on the floor in cuffs

349
00:24:20,894 --> 00:24:22,526
instead of on the floor dead!

350
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:24,926
Grace isn't dead, boss.
They knew we were coming.

351
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:27,583
The only question is how?

352
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:30,430
Well, that's a question
for another day.

353
00:24:30,463 --> 00:24:32,158
You're stood down
till I fill out my report.

354
00:24:32,191 --> 00:24:34,782
Well, hang on, boss.
You weren't there.

355
00:24:34,815 --> 00:24:36,991
Order stands.
And get that sorted.

356
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,695
Nasty, that.

357
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:48,351
(SAS operator)
<i>That's Alpha now airborne. Out.</i>

358
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,846
You alright, mate?

359
00:24:54,879 --> 00:24:56,254
Yeah.

360
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:58,111
- That's balls, innit?
- What?

361
00:24:58,142 --> 00:25:00,862
- You getting stood down.
- Oh. It'll be alright.

362
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:04,350
- You?
- Oh, yeah.

363
00:25:04,382 --> 00:25:05,822
Yeah, that blast is nothing

364
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:08,478
compared to the damage
your couch has done to my back.

365
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:11,102
You'll be happy to fuck off
at the end of the month, then.

366
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:14,271
Eh? What, you and Soph
moving in together?

367
00:25:14,302 --> 00:25:16,126
More than that.

368
00:25:16,158 --> 00:25:19,198
Oh, Christ. Well, come on, then,
let's see it.

369
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:20,830
- What?
- The ring.

370
00:25:20,862 --> 00:25:23,038
- It must rival Gibraltar.
- (laughs)

371
00:25:23,071 --> 00:25:27,007
Nah. It's just something
my nanna gave me.

372
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,166
I'm sure Soph'll be
suitably impressed.

373
00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:33,598
She's quite sober
when it comes to money.

374
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:35,070
Well, it's easy for you to say.

375
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:36,638
My ex-missus
burned my bank statement.

376
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,942
Dumped the ashes in my mouth.

377
00:25:38,974 --> 00:25:40,894
'Cause you paid for lap dances
with your credit card.

378
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:43,102
Yeah, I was pissed, though,
wasn't I?

379
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:44,287
Oh, man, you haven't got a clue

380
00:25:44,318 --> 00:25:46,142
what you're
getting yourself into.

381
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:48,639
- No.
- You haven't, have you?

382
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,142
(both laugh)

383
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,871
It'll be alright.

384
00:25:51,902 --> 00:25:53,950
So, what,
you gonna leave the regiment?

385
00:25:53,982 --> 00:25:56,094
Of course not. It's home.

386
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,918
Do you love her?

387
00:26:03,454 --> 00:26:05,215
Yeah.

388
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:07,742
Mate, how long
have we known each other?

389
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,598
Since basic. Why?

390
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,542
In that whole time, I have never
ever known you to love anyone.

391
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:16,254
- Well, this is different.
- Oh, yeah? How's that?

392
00:26:17,566 --> 00:26:19,678
Fuck off.

393
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,342
Go on, boys, let's go.
In the van.

394
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,006
(man) <i>The fact that

In Hereford.
Wouldn't wanna miss our flight.

402
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:44,702
Well, I'm afraid
triage is not my area.

403
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:46,335
Well, you've done a good job.

404
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:48,159
Are you sure you don't want
anything for the pain?

405
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,598
No.

00:27:03,103 --> 00:27:06,878
Shot her?
Yeah. Yeah, in the face.

413
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:10,495
Are you upset?

414
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,110
She was in the fight.
It was me or her.

415
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:16,766
Still, don't you
find it disturbing?

416
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:20,191
No.

417
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,022
I should know better by now.

418
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,446
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't know, Tom.

419
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,590
Does anything
ever affect you? Ever?

420
00:27:30,622 --> 00:27:31,806
No, never.

421
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:35,455
Apart from you.

422
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,886
I really wanna believe that
right now.

423
00:27:37,918 --> 00:27:39,326
Then do.

424
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,062
We're so different.

425
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:45,950
Well, that's what
makes it work.

426
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,782
Look, I love
being with you, Tom...

427
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:55,550
but I don't understand you.

428
00:27:55,582 --> 00:27:58,334
Then let's talk about this.
In Paris.

429
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,182
Hmm?

430
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,151
Only if you're willing
to really talk.

431
00:28:09,182 --> 00:28:11,614
Absolutely.

432
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:18,846
We will spend the entire time
in Paris in bed talking.

433
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:31,742
There is something seriously
wrong with you, Tom Buckingham.

434
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:34,207
You still have
your plane ticket?

435
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:35,806
Nah, I binned it.

436
00:28:35,838 --> 00:28:37,599
Good. Change of plans.

437
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,519
I'm taking you
on the first train to Paris

438
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,991
before you can bin me too.

439
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,366

In the fight?

462
00:30:46,174 --> 00:30:47,422
- You?
- Yeah.

463
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:49,503

Tom, who is this woman?

468
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:01,054
What woman?

469
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,974
The one with her face plastered
all over the newspaper.

470
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,821
- Yeah, didn't see that.
- It's hard to miss.

472

Tom, what really happened
yesterday?

473
00:32:10,175 --> 00:32:14,398
'Cause you can tell me.
Tom, where are you going?

474
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,863

487
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,183
Morning, mate. How are you?

488
00:34:09,214 --> 00:34:11,103
I have Grace Lewis
on the Eurostream

489
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,470
to Paris Gare du Nord.

490
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,743
- Grace Lewis?
- Train's mobile.

491
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:17,534
We're approaching
the Channel Tunnel.

492
00:34:17,567 --> 00:34:19,583
Hold on. What are you doing
on the Eurostream?

493
00:34:27,487 --> 00:34:31,614
Just wait till he's older.
Takes them ages to have a pee.

494
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:36,895
If that was his only flaw,
I'd marry him tomorrow.

495
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:41,535
Well, it's six o'clock
somewhere.

496
00:34:42,461 --> 00:34:43,839
Aren't you having one?

497
00:34:49,118 --> 00:34:50,494
Sure.

498
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:52,894
A marriage proposal?

499
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:54,910
One day after he dropped a woman
on Hampstead Heath?

500
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:57,087
You know Tom. He's a romantic.

501
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:01,534
Well, this time, before I do
anything, I need eyes on Grace.

502
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,254
- Have Tom confirm it.
- Alright.

503
00:35:19,135 --> 00:35:21,055
(text alert)

504
00:35:26,655 --> 00:35:29,438
- Boss wants Grace confirmed.
- <i>We're almost in the tunnel.</i>

505
00:35:29,471 --> 00:35:31,230
Right, then safest option,

506
00:35:31,261 --> 00:35:33,631
<i>just let the French
lift Grace at Gare du Nord.</i>

507
00:35:33,663 --> 00:35:37,471
- No, fuck it. I'll confirm her.
- Tom, wai...

508
00:35:57,663 --> 00:35:59,391
I've been married 53 years

509
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:03,005
and I still don't understand
the old sweat.

510
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:05,118
So it doesn't get
any better, then?

511
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:07,007
Sorry?

512
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,414
So it doesn't get
any better, then?

513
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:16,285
- No, not really.
- Damn.

514
00:36:16,318 --> 00:36:18,783
I don't know.
We're just so different.

515
00:36:18,814 --> 00:36:20,478
In what way?

516
00:36:21,694 --> 00:36:24,287
He takes lives for a living.
I save them.

517
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:27,102
Oh, I see. Military man, is he?

518
00:36:28,158 --> 00:36:30,047
It has its uses, dear.

519
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:32,734
Tom pretends it doesn't
affect him, but it must do.

520
00:36:32,766 --> 00:36:36,671
Well, not everyone
needs a shoulder to cry on.

521
00:36:36,702 --> 00:36:38,461
I'd be lucky if he even shrugged
his shoulders,

522
00:36:38,494 --> 00:36:39,711
<i>let alone shed a tear.</i>

523
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:41,341
(woman) <i>And that's a problem,
is it?</i>

524
00:36:41,374 --> 00:36:43,165
(Sophie) <i>Well, yeah.</i>

525
00:36:43,198 --> 00:36:48,222
His crazy brain has a unique
ability to drive me crazy.

526
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:52,351
A man running long in the loo
is not unique.

527
00:36:52,383 --> 00:36:55,007
God alone knows
what they do in there.

528
00:36:55,038 --> 00:36:57,278
Shall I tell you what he did
to my dead cat?

529
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,127
- Your dead cat?
- Yeah.

530
00:37:00,158 --> 00:37:03,007
He found Chica in the garden,

531
00:37:03,038 --> 00:37:05,854
brought her in my flat
draped over his arm

532
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:07,711
in full rigor mortis.

533
00:37:07,743 --> 00:37:09,215
Oh, I see.

534
00:37:09,246 --> 00:37:10,302
He then proceeded to suggest

535
00:37:10,335 --> 00:37:12,191
we put her in the freezer

536
00:37:12,222 --> 00:37:13,598
until we got back from holiday.

537
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:16,798
- Oh, right.
- I refused, of course.

538
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:19,775
We canceled our holiday
and gave her a proper burial.

539
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:36,255
- (bleeping)
- Cover.

540
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:41,470
(driver)
This is a red trigger...

541
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,023
Oh!

542
00:37:54,591 --> 00:37:56,351
(alarm blares)

543
00:37:57,758 --> 00:38:00,351
Clear the tunnel and dispatch
the fire response team.

544
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:11,230
(sirens wail)

545
00:38:30,718 --> 00:38:32,735
Getting eyes
on the flash points now.

546
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:34,238
(bleeps)

547
00:38:38,911 --> 00:38:40,638
(alarm blares)

548
00:39:21,918 --> 00:39:23,806
(sirens wail)

549
00:39:29,822 --> 00:39:31,711
Wow. Really?

550
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:34,495
Yeah. Well,
it looked way better on him.

551
00:39:34,527 --> 00:39:38,302
- And the kit?
- Relax. I got you.

552
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,886
You're only as good
as your worst day, huh?

553
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:57,758
(Olly) OK, listen in.
Remember, short, sharp commands.

554
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,638
We need
to take control immediately.

555
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:05,726
If anyone disobeys, ignores,
doesn't understand, tough shit.

556
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:08,383
You will make
an example of them.

557
00:40:08,414 --> 00:40:11,935
We need to grip that train
from the get-go. You understand?

558
00:40:11,966 --> 00:40:13,791
(Black Swan) Remember,
all keep switched on.

559
00:40:13,822 --> 00:40:16,990
Everyone, fingers out your
arses. We need to move in two.

560
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,807
Breach! Breach!

561
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,758
- (Olly) On me.
- (Black Swan) Come on, go!

562
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:26,046
(Black Swan) Cover me.

563
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:40,030
- Who the fuck was that?
- Don't know. But he's trained.

564
00:40:41,854 --> 00:40:43,646
Everybody back.

565
00:40:43,678 --> 00:40:45,182
(bleeping)

566
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:55,998
(screaming)

567
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:10,270
Oh, my God. What's happened? Oh.

568
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:19,742
Oh, I've got...
I've got some glass in my leg.

569
00:41:19,774 --> 00:41:22,174
OK. Don't worry,
I'll get it out.

570
00:41:22,207 --> 00:41:23,710
Oh, fuck.

571
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:26,878
(ringing tone)

572
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:30,462
- OK.
- (text alert)

573
00:41:30,495 --> 00:41:33,310
Just keep still.
It's gonna be alright.

574
00:41:35,134 --> 00:41:37,310
<i>This is Dr. Hart.
Please leave a message.</i>

575
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:40,447
Stay in your seat.
I'm coming for you.

576
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:42,910
There's a player
in the battle space.

577
00:41:42,942 --> 00:41:44,670
He's armed and skilled.

578
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,038
Check the tunnel, check the
train, check the passengers,

579
00:41:47,071 --> 00:41:48,862
and do not let him get away.

580
00:41:48,895 --> 00:41:51,775
- (woman) Roger. We're on it.
- (Olly) Everyone spread out.

581
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:53,566
Alright.

582
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:56,606
This'll stop the bleeding.
It's gonna be alright.

583
00:41:58,366 --> 00:42:01,054
(man) <i>Assieds-toi. Reste ici.
Les filles, non, vous asseyez.</i>

584
00:42:01,086 --> 00:42:02,238
<i>Asseyez-vous.</i>

585
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:06,750
Everybody sit down!
Don't you fucking move!

586
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,087
Heads down! You, eyes down now!

587
00:42:13,118 --> 00:42:14,911
Stay down!

588
00:42:14,942 --> 00:42:16,798
(gunshot)

589
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:18,878
Down! Move!

590
00:42:21,246 --> 00:42:22,591
(screaming)

591
00:42:22,622 --> 00:42:25,342
If you want to live,
shut the fuck up.

592
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:27,326
Don't move! Stay where you are!

593
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:30,686
Everyone remain calm.
Get back in your seats.

594
00:42:30,718 --> 00:42:32,895
Keep your hands
above your heads.

595
00:42:34,782 --> 00:42:39,070
I said get the fuck
back to your seat.

596
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:40,382
(gunshot)

597
00:42:40,414 --> 00:42:42,174
(screaming)

598
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,758
Listen in.

599
00:42:45,790 --> 00:42:49,246
Do what you're told
when you're told,

600
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:50,942
and that...

601
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,302
Sit the fuck down!

602
00:42:56,415 --> 00:42:58,750
And that will not happen to you.

603
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:05,950
(Black Swan) Heads down.

604
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:07,838
(man) I just need
to get her inhaler. Please...

605
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:09,535
Get back in your fucking seat.

606
00:43:09,566 --> 00:43:12,990
- (Olly) I need you outside.
- Yeah, alright, now.

607
00:43:18,782 --> 00:43:20,222
(phone rings)

608
00:43:22,303 --> 00:43:24,702
- Give us what you got, mate.
- (Tom) <i>Grace confirmed.</i>

609
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:25,918
<i>I don't know what it means yet,</i>

610
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:27,742
but it's not an escape,
it's an attack.

611
00:43:27,775 --> 00:43:29,374
<i>She's got support down here.</i>

612
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,582
<i>About two dozen Swans,
all armed.</i>

613
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:33,502
<i>Stand to the team.</i>

614
00:43:33,535 --> 00:43:35,358
<i>(screaming)</i>

615
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,886
You gonna come out and meet us
at the point of entry, yeah?

616
00:43:37,918 --> 00:43:39,902
I have to find Sophie.

617
00:43:39,934 --> 00:43:41,374
Too many Swans, mate.
They'll smash you.

618
00:43:41,406 --> 00:43:42,910
Just wait till we get there.

619
00:43:42,942 --> 00:43:44,990
No time.
Text me when you're on site.

620
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,134
<i>I'm gonna run a CTR.</i>

621
00:43:52,414 --> 00:43:54,878
If you attempt to disembark,
you'll be shot and killed,

622
00:43:54,911 --> 00:43:57,470
so please stay on the train.

623
00:43:57,502 --> 00:44:00,415
Do what you're told
when you're told.

624
00:44:00,446 --> 00:44:03,039
(Black Swan) Get fucking down.
Just sit down!

625
00:44:05,182 --> 00:44:08,990
Get down now! Be fucking quiet!

626
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:11,902
If you can see my eyes,
I can see yours!

627
00:44:11,935 --> 00:44:14,462
Look at the fucking ground!

628
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:18,911
Shit.

629
00:44:18,943 --> 00:44:24,318
(Black Swan) Everyone stay down,
stay calm, do not fucking move,

630
00:44:24,350 --> 00:44:26,846
take deep breaths,

631
00:44:26,878 --> 00:44:28,382
and all will be fine.

632
00:44:28,414 --> 00:44:31,327
Don't fuck about.
Don't make me shoot you.

633
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,662
Stay fucking calm.

634
00:44:45,406 --> 00:44:47,230
(commander) <i>I don't care
what Tom wants.</i>

635
00:44:47,262 --> 00:44:49,438
Tell him to withdraw
from the tunnel.

636
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:54,974
Well, he's already
on a close target recce. Look.

637
00:44:57,247 --> 00:45:01,087
Tom is putting innocent lives
in danger. Get him out.

638
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,654
And forward me those photos.

639
00:45:02,686 --> 00:45:04,382
I need to run 'em
up the food chain.

640
00:45:04,414 --> 00:45:07,390
The PM has asked
for all the latest intelligence.

641
00:45:07,422 --> 00:45:09,214
There you go. Sent.

642
00:45:23,998 --> 00:45:26,015
Service tunnel secure,
and UK-bound tunnel blocked

643
00:45:26,047 --> 00:45:27,710
<i>by fire and thick smoke.</i>

644
00:45:27,742 --> 00:45:29,342
(Grace) <i>Roger that.
Start the drilling.</i>

645
00:45:29,374 --> 00:45:31,294
<i>Get me a sitrep in five.</i>

646
00:45:31,326 --> 00:45:34,142
<i>I want the player found
and dropped now.</i>

647
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:51,422
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-4. All my
call signs ready to load.</i>

648
00:45:52,638 --> 00:45:54,718
(pilot 2) <i>Papa 1-6. Confirmed.</i>

649
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,639
(commander) <i>Alpha. All red

650
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:03,487
(text alert)

651
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:07,838
Guns are set.

652
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:11,038
Player's running a CTR.

653
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:17,662
(Olly) He's looking for holes
in your protection bubble.

654
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:20,382
And a way into the carriages.

655
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:22,591
Especially seven,
eight and nine.

656
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:25,503
Good work.

657
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:52,158
Find the player.

658
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:54,463
Confiscate every phone from
every passenger in every coach.

659
00:46:54,495 --> 00:46:57,215
If someone refuses, shoot them.

660
00:47:09,181 --> 00:47:11,647
Please hand over
any electronic devices.

661
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:13,342
(man) There you are.

662
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:20,574
In your own time, sir.

663
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,710
In your own time, gentlemen.

664
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,110
Thank you.

665
00:47:41,982 --> 00:47:43,359
Really?

666
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,686
- What?
- What, are you 12?

667
00:47:46,718 --> 00:47:49,406
Am I gonna get it back?
It cost me 500 quid.

668
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:56,286
And I'm the criminal.

669
00:48:02,078 --> 00:48:03,901
(newsreader) <i>Some major
breaking news to bring you.</i>

670
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:07,135
<i>Multiple sources are telling us
that a Eurostream train</i>

671
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:09,119
has been hijacked.

672
00:48:09,151 --> 00:48:11,581
We have very few details so far.

673
00:48:11,614 --> 00:48:13,055
What we do know
is that the train

674
00:48:13,087 --> 00:48:14,943
was heading
for Paris Gare du Nord

675
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,727
when it was commandeered
in the Channel Tunnel.

676
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:19,839
There's no word
on who's behind it

677
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:21,695
or what their motives might be,

678
00:48:21,727 --> 00:48:23,230
<i>but if confirmed, this would be</i>

679
00:48:23,262 --> 00:48:26,206
<i>a major incident
on British soil.</i>

680
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,030
Why is she still breathing?

681
00:48:28,062 --> 00:48:30,750
I zapped Lewis at Hampstead
Heath, but Grace weren't in.

682
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:33,822
- But how did she manage that?
- Someone might have warned her.

683
00:48:33,854 --> 00:48:37,150
- Someone?
- I'll find him.

684
00:48:37,183 --> 00:48:39,934
- Sky News has it.
- Do they have Grace?

685
00:48:39,967 --> 00:48:41,823
Not yet. Still speculating.

686
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:43,743
Right. I'm convening Cobra.

687
00:48:46,366 --> 00:48:47,519
If she exposes what we've done,

688
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:48,990
this is not
just a problem for you,

689
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:50,878
this is a very big problem
for me.

690
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:54,207
The Eurostream has stopped on
British soil, so it's your call.

691
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:55,934
Do I have control?

692
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:58,718
Yes. Get down there
and kill her.

693
00:49:01,566 --> 00:49:04,863
Listen up! I need everyone's
phones out. Phones out.

694
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:12,415
- Where's your phone?
- I do not have one.

695
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:14,271
I lost it during the explosion.

696
00:49:14,303 --> 00:49:15,966
Shame.

697
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:17,247
- (gunshot)
- (screaming)

698
00:49:17,279 --> 00:49:19,390
(whimpers)

699
00:49:23,518 --> 00:49:26,365
Anyone have any medical training
on this train, huh?

700
00:49:27,486 --> 00:49:28,735
Can you get a doctor?

701
00:49:33,567 --> 00:49:37,086
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-4. On final
approach to the tunnel.</i>

702
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,783
I'm a doctor.

703
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:07,934
Can you fix, uh, it?

704
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:12,606
(whimpers)

705
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:15,518
If I can get a trauma kit and
some running water, then yeah.

706
00:50:17,534 --> 00:50:21,181
I'm gonna take care of you,
OK? Come on. It's alright.

707
00:50:21,214 --> 00:50:24,447
Come on. It's gonna be OK.

708
00:50:42,655 --> 00:50:43,807
Stay close.

709
00:50:45,663 --> 00:50:49,215
Red 2. UK-bound tunnel
compromised by fire and smoke.

710
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:51,870
French tunnel compromised
by up to 24 Black Swans.

711
00:50:51,901 --> 00:50:55,103
All red call signs will proceed
via central service tunnel.

712
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:58,525
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-5.
Final approach now.</i>

713
00:50:58,558 --> 00:51:01,758
(pilot 2) <i>Papa 1-6. Holding.</i>

714
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,743
(commander)
<i>All call signs, this is Alpha.</i>

715
00:51:03,775 --> 00:51:05,310
<i>Hold at the tunnel entrance.</i>

716
00:51:05,341 --> 00:51:07,743
(pilot 2) <i>Red 1-6.
Roger that. Out.</i>

717
00:51:18,271 --> 00:51:19,645
It's OK, it's OK.

718
00:51:21,855 --> 00:51:23,518
Stay there.

719
00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:31,325
Can we have
some privacy, please?

720
00:51:38,078 --> 00:51:41,022
Red 2. Fire door, 20 meters out.

721
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,838
Everyone.

722
00:52:07,805 --> 00:52:09,791
Red 3. Fire door is obstructed.

723
00:52:09,822 --> 00:52:11,967
Needs explosive entry
and that will compromise us.

724
00:52:11,998 --> 00:52:14,687
All call signs
set up a control point.

725
00:52:17,054 --> 00:52:19,518
(girl whimpers)

726
00:52:22,687 --> 00:52:24,030
OK.

727
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,598
- Any word from Tom?
- I'm waiting on a call back.

728
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:35,935
- Olivia, up yet?
- No, nothing, sir.

729
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:45,471
Right, listen in.
Stand to the emergency response.

730
00:52:45,502 --> 00:52:47,231
- I want the team in now.
- We've just set up.

731
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:49,054
So's Grace.

732
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:51,391
- We're completely in the blind.
- Get some fucking glasses.

733
00:52:51,423 --> 00:52:54,111
- They zapped the CCTV, sir.
- We need people on the ground.

734
00:52:54,142 --> 00:52:55,839
We need to carry out
a proper CTR.

735
00:52:55,871 --> 00:52:57,822
- Well, who took these, then?
- Tom.

736
00:52:57,855 --> 00:52:59,679
Tom?

737
00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:01,791
Buckingham.

738
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:03,903
Was he the bloke that zapped
that woman on Hampstead Heath?

739
00:53:03,934 --> 00:53:07,198
- Yeah.
- Good skills for a posh twat.

740
00:53:07,229 --> 00:53:09,535
So, hold on a minute.
How come he's inside the cordon?

741
00:53:09,567 --> 00:53:13,503
He was taking his girlfriend
to Paris to propose.

742
00:53:13,534 --> 00:53:15,391
Well, the Swans have done him
a fucking favor, then.

743
00:53:15,423 --> 00:53:17,725
OK, back to what we're here for.
These photos are not enough.

744
00:53:17,758 --> 00:53:19,741
Well, they are today,
'cause Grace is the target.

745
00:53:19,775 --> 00:53:20,895
We have no idea where she is.

746
00:53:20,926 --> 00:53:22,270
The moment you make contact,

747
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,541
Grace will close in
and she will fight.

748
00:53:24,575 --> 00:53:25,887
But today
she's got nowhere to go.

749
00:53:25,918 --> 00:53:27,615
My job is to rescue hostages.

750
00:53:27,646 --> 00:53:29,695
Not today. Hit that train now.

751
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,391
If we do that,
we will take casualties.

752
00:53:31,422 --> 00:53:33,375
Just give me a moment
to plan a deliberate option...

753
00:53:33,406 --> 00:53:36,029
What are you, the head
of a fucking knitting circle?

754
00:53:36,062 --> 00:53:38,046
The Swans are split up,
two to a carriage.

755
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:39,999
- Now's the time to attack.
- I don't agree with you.

756
00:53:40,031 --> 00:53:42,238
Well, you can disagree
all you fucking like, mate,

757
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,871
but this is what's gonna happen.

758
00:53:43,902 --> 00:53:45,565
You are gonna act
like a professional soldier.

759
00:53:45,598 --> 00:53:47,806
You are gonna initiate
emergency response.

760
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:49,469
And you are gonna kill Grace.

761
00:53:49,502 --> 00:53:54,335
And if you don't,
you are off and he is on.

762
00:53:54,366 --> 00:53:55,870
Do you understand?

763
00:54:07,038 --> 00:54:09,151
Oh, fucking hell.

764
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:17,566
(text alert)

765
00:54:28,191 --> 00:54:29,374
Shit.

766
00:54:29,407 --> 00:54:31,198
Not right now,
if you don't mind.

767
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:34,751
Here.

768
00:54:34,782 --> 00:54:37,054
Unscrew the toilet
and I'll get you down.

769
00:54:37,087 --> 00:54:38,622
No.

770
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:42,814
No? What do you mean, no?

771
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,446
I need to stay here
and help the wounded.

772
00:54:44,478 --> 00:54:46,335
Soph, the team
are about to hit this train,

773
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,542
and when they do, there are
gonna be a lot more casualties.

774
00:54:48,574 --> 00:54:49,950
You're not gonna be one of them.

775
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:51,231
Sorry.

776
00:54:51,262 --> 00:54:53,118
I'm staying here.

777
00:54:55,071 --> 00:54:57,886
I have a wounded girl here.
Save her instead.

778
00:54:57,918 --> 00:54:59,230
If you stay on this train,
you will die.

779
00:54:59,263 --> 00:55:00,895
- I am not leaving.
- Soph...

780
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:03,519
I am not leaving.

781
00:55:10,142 --> 00:55:11,358
Roger that.

782
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:13,502
Red 2. Moving now.

783
00:55:13,534 --> 00:55:16,382
(commander)
<i>Alpha. Good luck. Out.</i>

784
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:59,166
Sierra 1.
Rear locomotive unmanned.

785
00:56:00,415 --> 00:56:02,398
Roger that. Proceed.

786
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:16,446
(Black Swan)
What's going on in there?

787
00:56:16,479 --> 00:56:18,239
OK, come on. Quickly. Quickly.

788
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:18,910
(Black Swan) Oi.

789
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,159
(knocking)

790
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:21,535
What's going on?

791
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:23,999
That's it. There you go.

792
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:26,175
- (Black Swan) Open the door.
- Jesus Christ, Tom.

793
00:56:26,206 --> 00:56:28,126
- (Black Swan) Open the door.
- What?

794
00:56:28,158 --> 00:56:29,822
You'd make a great father.

795
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:32,095
- Well, it worked, didn't it?
- (Black Swan) Oi!

796
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:42,239
- (Black Swan) Open the door!
- Knock me out.

797
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:43,615
- What?
- I said open the fucking door!

798
00:56:43,646 --> 00:56:46,783
So it doesn't look like
I helped you.

799
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:49,375
(Black Swan) Open this door now.

800
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,198
It's a good idea.

801
00:56:51,231 --> 00:56:53,342
(Black Swan) The kid escaped.

802
00:56:57,055 --> 00:56:59,071
Up top! Contact!

803
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,902
(commander) <i>This is Alpha.
Withdraw now.</i>

804
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:10,622
Bin it! Bin it! Bin it!

805
00:57:13,502 --> 00:57:16,030
Coach 9. Converge. Converge!

806
00:57:16,062 --> 00:57:17,886
(in French)

807
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:21,918
Move!

808
00:57:22,975 --> 00:57:24,446
Stop!

809
00:57:25,822 --> 00:57:27,454
Fuck.

810
00:57:28,894 --> 00:57:30,590
(gunfire continues)

811
00:57:30,622 --> 00:57:32,671
Shit.

812
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,726
Move!

813
00:57:44,766 --> 00:57:46,078
Move. Move!

814
00:58:01,694 --> 00:58:03,326
Shit.

815
00:58:04,862 --> 00:58:06,238
Move!

816
00:58:12,574 --> 00:58:14,366
What happened here?

817
00:58:14,398 --> 00:58:17,566
The player breached in, smashed
the doctor, lifted the kid.

818
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:20,254
He's more effective
than the SAS.

819
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:24,286
I pushed them back
to the control point.

820
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:27,006
Yeah, because my source told us
that they were coming.

821
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:28,830
- Your fucking snide?
- He's our fucking snide.

822
00:58:28,862 --> 00:58:30,686
And he's a critical part
of this operation.

823
00:58:30,718 --> 00:58:33,886
Yeah, well, someone still
had to pull the trigger.

824
00:58:33,918 --> 00:58:36,190
And it's a really good skill.

825
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:38,878
Now use it to find
the kid and the player.

826
00:58:38,911 --> 00:58:40,926
They were last seen down there.

827
00:58:43,359 --> 00:58:45,598
(Black Swan)
You're all doing a good job.

828
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,455
Stay just like that

829
00:58:47,486 --> 00:58:50,366
and not long from now
you'll be safe at home

830
00:58:50,398 --> 00:58:53,215
selling your story
to the papers.

831
00:58:53,246 --> 00:58:55,358
Be famous, not dead.

832
00:58:57,822 --> 00:58:59,614
(girl gasps)

833
00:59:11,102 --> 00:59:13,438
- (man) That was a gang fuck.
- (commander) Who's down?

834
00:59:13,471 --> 00:59:15,870
- (man) It was Rich and Pat.
- (commander) Shit.

835
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:22,206
So where is she?

836
00:59:22,238 --> 00:59:23,870
Is that really
your major concern right now?

837
00:59:23,902 --> 00:59:26,110
No, my major concern
is that you fucked it up.

838
00:59:26,143 --> 00:59:27,710
I told you it was too soon.

839
00:59:27,742 --> 00:59:29,470
And I told you
I wanted Grace dead.

840
00:59:29,502 --> 00:59:32,286
- So where is she?
- She knew we were coming.

841
00:59:34,398 --> 00:59:36,542
- How?
- I don't know.

842
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:39,166
The Swans weren't split up
two per carriage.

843
00:59:39,198 --> 00:59:41,438
They were on the roof of
the train, waiting to smash us.

844
00:59:41,471 --> 00:59:43,934
He's right, it was a trap.

845
01:00:36,127 --> 01:00:37,726
(computer chimes)

846
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,278
Who installed Skype
on an internal system?

847
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:46,238
This came in via our intranet.
Should I... Should I answer it?

848
01:00:47,262 --> 01:00:48,607
Yeah, go on.

849
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:52,830
<i>I wanna speak
to the ground commander.</i>

850
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:54,750
Major Bisset.
Special Air Service.

851
01:00:54,782 --> 01:00:56,190
I'm here to negotiate
a peaceful resolution.

852
01:00:56,222 --> 01:00:57,758
<i>Thanks to
your assault yesterday,</i>

853
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:58,910
<i>we're left
with only two options.</i>

854
01:00:58,942 --> 01:01:00,510
Which are?

855
01:01:00,542 --> 01:01:01,918
<i>The prime minister
can go on live TV</i>

856
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,518
<i>and admit that
the British government</i>

857
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,438
<i>ordered that clearing op
in Georgia.</i>

858
01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:07,230
<i>Or he can outfit that
Eurocopter you flew in</i>

859
01:01:07,262 --> 01:01:08,350
<i>with extra fuel bladders</i>

860
01:01:08,382 --> 01:01:09,598
<i>and wire 500 million</i>

861
01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:11,679
<i>to an account
of my designation.</i>

862
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:13,214
That's a lot of money
to organize.

863
01:01:13,246 --> 01:01:15,038
<i>Britgaz can manage it.</i>

864
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:17,471
- Why would they pay for it?
- <i>They hired us to do the job.</i>

865
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:20,222
<i>Well, actually,
they hired the SAS to hire us.</i>

866
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,718
<i>But those details are best left
for the war crimes tribunal.</i>

867
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,766
<i>In the event
we don't get that ransom.</i>

868
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:26,622
That's really not my concern.

869
01:01:26,654 --> 01:01:28,798
- My only job is to protect...
- <i>Protect British interests.</i>

870
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:31,839
<i>Both military and economic.
Ask Clements.</i>

871
01:01:31,871 --> 01:01:35,166
<i>I'm sure he's lurking
around your control point.</i>

872
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:38,559
(sighs)

873
01:01:40,094 --> 01:01:41,822
I want
a hundred hostages released

874
01:01:41,854 --> 01:01:43,102
as a show of good faith.

875
01:01:43,135 --> 01:01:44,862
<i>Agreed.</i>

876
01:01:44,894 --> 01:01:48,095
<i>But you'll have to come
and get them yourself.</i>

877
01:01:48,127 --> 01:01:49,918
<i>And bring Clements.</i>

878
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:59,070
What you fucking looking at?

879
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:03,423
(in French)

880
01:03:12,607 --> 01:03:14,495
You know she only wants you
in there so she can kill you?

881
01:03:14,527 --> 01:03:15,838
Yeah.

882
01:03:18,078 --> 01:03:21,950
And the only reason I'm going
in there is to kill her first.

883
01:03:21,982 --> 01:03:23,135
Oh, really?

884
01:03:24,638 --> 01:03:25,758
How you gonna do that?

885
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,670
Find out when we get there.

886
01:03:28,702 --> 01:03:30,783
(Black Swan) <i>This is 1-4.
I have a weeper.</i>

887
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,318
<i>He's hyperventilating.</i>

888
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:34,719
<i>Crying, begging,
starting to lose it.</i>

889
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:39,230
<i>I need someone to me now
to lift him and isolate him...</i>

890
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:41,182
(in French)

891
01:04:18,623 --> 01:04:19,743
<i>Viens.</i>

892
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:33,694
<i>Viens, viens.</i>

893
01:04:33,726 --> 01:04:36,445
All call signs.
Rear cockpit. Go!

894
01:04:36,478 --> 01:04:39,421
The player's
in the rear cockpit. Go, go, go!

895
01:04:51,423 --> 01:04:53,247
(yells)

896
01:04:57,951 --> 01:04:59,774
Fuck.

897
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,310
Where's the player?

898
01:05:09,342 --> 01:05:11,487
He saved the girl.

899
01:05:12,735 --> 01:05:14,974
But stayed in the fight.

900
01:05:17,215 --> 01:05:19,390
- There you are.
- <i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

901
01:05:19,423 --> 01:05:21,598
If this little fucker
can push through their defenses,

902
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:22,718
then so can we.

903
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:24,541
So let's crack on.

904
01:05:24,574 --> 01:05:25,823
Dec.

905
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:28,350
We're gonna get these hostages.

906
01:05:28,381 --> 01:05:30,655
You're in command
till I get back.

907
01:05:32,703 --> 01:05:36,286
Why'd you help that man
break inside the train?

908
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:38,303
I didn't. I was helping
the little girl like you asked,

909
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:40,447
and then a man
unscrewed the toilet.

910
01:05:41,118 --> 01:05:42,271
Hmm.

911
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,774
Are you his wife?

912
01:05:47,806 --> 01:05:49,855
I'm not married.

913
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:57,407
You're lying.

914
01:05:57,438 --> 01:06:00,318
Look what he did to my face.

915
01:06:00,351 --> 01:06:04,094
This isn't her phone.
Just FYI.

916
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:10,143
Where is your real phone, hmm?

917
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,031
Lover boy call it
to arrange your escape?

918
01:06:12,063 --> 01:06:14,110
I didn't try to escape.

919
01:06:15,518 --> 01:06:17,823
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

920
01:06:20,638 --> 01:06:22,719
Take her to the toilet
and find her real phone.

921
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,543
And stay professional.

922
01:07:26,783 --> 01:07:29,758
Stay professional.

923
01:07:29,791 --> 01:07:32,125
Have you found
her real phone yet?

924
01:07:32,607 --> 01:07:33,694
Not yet.

925
01:07:43,805 --> 01:07:45,087
(drilling)

926
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:17,758
(Grace)
<i>If I didn't know any better,</i>

927
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,847
<i>I'd think you were the player.</i>

928
01:08:18,879 --> 01:08:21,150
I'll take that as a compliment.

929
01:08:22,654 --> 01:08:24,925
How long have you been dating?

930
01:08:25,503 --> 01:08:28,287
Never met him.

931
01:08:28,318 --> 01:08:29,982
But if you could be kind enough
to introduce us,

932
01:08:30,015 --> 01:08:32,254
I'd love
to take him out for dinner.

933
01:08:32,287 --> 01:08:35,485
<i>He's starting
to sound like my type.</i>

934
01:08:55,071 --> 01:08:56,254
<i>(drilling)</i>

935
01:08:57,598 --> 01:08:58,815
<i>(drilling stops)</i>

936
01:09:08,415 --> 01:09:10,335
Is it through?

937
01:09:14,142 --> 01:09:16,126
It looks like
we have the clearance.

938
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:20,095
Find Grace
and tell her we're through.

939
01:09:20,127 --> 01:09:22,207
I'll get started on the device.

940
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:23,838
(Black Swan) Roger that.

941
01:09:36,989 --> 01:09:38,431
Cute.

942
01:09:38,463 --> 01:09:41,438
- Found your phone.
- Fuck.

943
01:10:03,391 --> 01:10:04,895
Careful.

944
01:10:37,951 --> 01:10:39,582
Hello, Grace.

945
01:10:57,790 --> 01:10:59,935
Can I offer you a drink?

946
01:10:59,967 --> 01:11:03,711
Ooh, yeah, I'll have...
I'll have a glass of champagne.

947
01:11:44,958 --> 01:11:47,550
- So where are the hostages?
- Hmm?

948
01:11:47,582 --> 01:11:49,118
Oh, they're not going anywhere.

949
01:11:49,150 --> 01:11:51,326
So why are we here?

950
01:11:58,366 --> 01:12:01,534
You probably thought
that was gonna be you.

951
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,351
Actually, I thought
it was gonna be you.

952
01:12:04,382 --> 01:12:06,238
I know that's what
you're here for.

953
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:09,951
So, let's try this again,
shall we?

954
01:12:09,982 --> 01:12:12,766
- Grace Lewis.
- George Clements.

955
01:12:16,063 --> 01:12:19,678
Calm down.
We have a lot to discuss.

956
01:12:20,702 --> 01:12:22,110
No, we don't.

957
01:12:22,142 --> 01:12:24,286
You hired us to do a job.

958
01:12:24,318 --> 01:12:26,046
Yeah, you didn't do it properly.

959
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:28,447
You said clear the village,
and we did.

960
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,782
You fucked up.
You left witnesses.

961
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:34,142
They were supposed
to spread the fear.

962
01:12:34,174 --> 01:12:36,542
They spread the fear alright.

963
01:12:36,574 --> 01:12:38,110
Did it work?

964
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,902
Did any other village
ever refuse

965
01:12:39,934 --> 01:12:42,206
to sell you their land
after that?

966
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:44,415
Answer me.

967
01:12:44,446 --> 01:12:46,526
No, the pipeline went through.

968
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:50,590
Low-intensity ops.
It's a nasty business.

969
01:12:50,623 --> 01:12:53,759
But it's fucking effective.

970
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:55,679
Your friends
wrote the textbook for it.

971
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:58,238
Well, perhaps
you should have read Chapter 10.

972
01:12:58,270 --> 01:13:00,031
"Kill Kids With Mobile Phones."

973
01:13:00,062 --> 01:13:02,014
(Grace) <i>Or the prime minister</i>

974
01:13:02,047 --> 01:13:04,606
<i>could just admit
that he hired us.</i>

975
01:13:04,638 --> 01:13:06,942
(Clements)
<i>Clearly he ain't gonna do that.</i>

976
01:13:06,974 --> 01:13:10,206
(Grace) <i>Then clearly
we have to get paid.</i>

977
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:14,942
Payment can be arranged.
Britgaz has got...

978
01:13:14,974 --> 01:13:16,414
(Grace) <i>A pipeline
in the Channel Tunnel.</i>

979
01:13:16,447 --> 01:13:19,774
<i>Not many people
know about that.</i>

980
01:13:19,806 --> 01:13:21,022
<i>My father did.</i>

981
01:13:21,982 --> 01:13:23,519
<i>If you don't pay us,</i>

982
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:25,982
and guarantee safe passage,

983
01:13:26,014 --> 01:13:30,814
I will destroy this tunnel
and... everyone in it.

984
01:13:31,807 --> 01:13:35,486
<i>Do you understand?</i>

985
01:13:35,518 --> 01:13:40,959
If you well and truly fuck off,
I'll get you your money,

986
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:42,462
and your safe passage.

987
01:13:42,494 --> 01:13:44,702
Agreed.

988
01:13:44,734 --> 01:13:47,198
But I want wire confirmation
in the next 30 minutes.

989
01:13:47,230 --> 01:13:48,574
OK.

990
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:04,414
- You get that?
- Loud and clear.

991
01:14:05,982 --> 01:14:08,095
All call signs,
the device is in position

992
01:14:08,126 --> 01:14:10,782
and the anti-tamper triggers
are set.

993
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,639
Stand still.

994
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:16,894
Pull the trigger
and I'll detonate.

995
01:14:17,726 --> 01:14:19,742
Suicide bomber, are you?

996
01:14:19,774 --> 01:14:23,295
Well, we're all
about to get dead anyway.

997
01:14:23,326 --> 01:14:26,942
The ones that survive, enjoy.

998
01:14:26,974 --> 01:14:29,022
Not much joy in this job, mate.

999
01:14:29,055 --> 01:14:33,278
We either get we want
or we fuck you up severely.

1000
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:36,031
Hijack a train
under 75 meters of rock,

1001
01:14:36,062 --> 01:14:37,790
death is the most likely result.

1002
01:14:37,822 --> 01:14:39,710
And you and everyone else
in this tunnel

1003
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:41,791
will burn along with us.

1004
01:14:43,518 --> 01:14:45,118
Drop it.

1005
01:15:39,583 --> 01:15:41,438
(newsreader) <i>Eurostream
officials have so far</i>

1006
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:43,966

(woman) Sir Charles Whiteside
from Britgaz, Prime Minister.

1016
01:16:09,022 --> 01:16:12,094
(prime minister)
Thank you for coming.

1017
01:16:12,126 --> 01:16:14,718
So what does your board
have to say?

1018
01:16:16,574 --> 01:16:20,766
We've agreed your 500 million.
A bargain, really.

1019
01:16:20,799 --> 01:16:24,190
Of course, this stays
out of the public domain.

1020
01:16:24,222 --> 01:16:27,390
Britgaz doesn't pay ransoms,
do we?

1021
01:16:27,422 --> 01:16:28,894
Understood.

1022
01:16:51,262 --> 01:16:53,758
(phone rings)

1023
01:16:58,558 --> 01:16:59,646
Thank fuck you're still alive.

1024
01:16:59,678 --> 01:17:02,590
(chuckles)

1025
01:17:02,622 --> 01:17:04,830
Grace is gonna blow up
the tunnel.

1026
01:17:04,862 --> 01:17:06,782
Yeah, yeah, she made
the same threat to Clements.

1027
01:17:06,815 --> 01:17:09,695
It's not a threat.
I found the device.

1028
01:17:09,727 --> 01:17:13,918
- Next to a gas pipeline.
- Well, can you disarm it?

1029
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:17,150
<i>No. It has anti-tamper triggers
all over it.</i>

1030
01:17:17,182 --> 01:17:20,319
Tell Bisset
to get the team in there now.

1031
01:17:20,351 --> 01:17:21,886
Bisset's dead, mate.

1032
01:17:23,870 --> 01:17:26,047
- What?
- <i>Grace zapped him.</i>

1033
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:30,879
Christ. You have control?

1034
01:17:32,895 --> 01:17:35,262
- Yeah.
- <i>Then launch the ER yourself.</i>

1035
01:17:35,294 --> 01:17:36,575
Clements ordered us to wait out.

1036
01:17:36,607 --> 01:17:39,134
What, and let Grace
blow up the tunnel?

1037
01:17:39,166 --> 01:17:41,150
Britgaz just agreed to pay her.

1038
01:17:41,182 --> 01:17:42,974
<i>She'll trigger
the device anyway.</i>

1039
01:17:43,006 --> 01:17:45,022
This isn't about money.
It's revenge.

1040
01:17:45,054 --> 01:17:46,526
Yeah, I know,
and if I was in their shoes,

1041
01:17:46,558 --> 01:17:48,095
I'd be thinking the same thing.

1042
01:17:48,127 --> 01:17:49,950
But setting off a bomb in the
Channel Tunnel, it's suicidal.

1043
01:17:49,983 --> 01:17:52,350
She's operating
as if she's already dead.

1044
01:17:52,382 --> 01:17:53,887
Yeah, well,
if she blows the tunnel,

1045
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:56,222
she'd better hope Lewis
taught her how to swim out.

1046
01:17:56,254 --> 01:18:00,382
That's the real question, mate,
how does she plan to escape?

1047
01:18:03,134 --> 01:18:06,686
Listen... Tom, mate, just, um...

1048
01:18:07,998 --> 01:18:09,662
find a way out of there,
alright?

1049
01:18:09,694 --> 01:18:12,734
'Cause, I'll be honest,
I need your help, mate.

1050
01:18:12,766 --> 01:18:15,774
Yeah. Sophie needs it more.

1051
01:18:15,806 --> 01:18:17,983
Look, I get that you're in love
and all that.

1052
01:18:18,015 --> 01:18:21,118
- <i>I do.</i>
- No. I just got it now.

1053
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:22,591
(phone rings)

1054
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:26,974
Yeah, alright, mate.

1055
01:18:35,071 --> 01:18:36,223
Are you gonna blow the tunnel?

1056
01:18:36,255 --> 01:18:37,886
You sound awfully ungrateful

1057
01:18:37,918 --> 01:18:39,742
for someone
who just got promoted.

1058
01:18:39,774 --> 01:18:41,726
I agreed to help you escape.

1059
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:43,518
But taking
a gas pipeline hostage

1060
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:44,639
was never part of the plan.

1061
01:18:44,671 --> 01:18:45,663
<i>Declan, you're just a tiny part</i>

1062
01:18:45,695 --> 01:18:47,262
<i>of this operation.</i>

1063
01:18:47,294 --> 01:18:48,670
Actually, no,
I'm a mission-critical part.

1064
01:18:48,703 --> 01:18:50,270
Assuming you wanna
get out of there alive.

1065
01:18:50,302 --> 01:18:51,966
We're already dead.

1066
01:18:51,998 --> 01:18:54,750
And you will be too
if we don't kill this player.

1067
01:18:57,918 --> 01:19:00,190
<i>He's one of yours, isn't he?</i>

1068
01:19:00,223 --> 01:19:01,758
I've got him under control.

1069
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:04,350
- The fuck you do. Where is he?
- I don't know.

1070
01:19:04,381 --> 01:19:05,823
<i>You must be
in contact with him.</i>

1071
01:19:05,855 --> 01:19:07,582
Yeah, I am,
but I don't know where he is.

1072
01:19:07,614 --> 01:19:10,206
Let's start with his name.

1073
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,559
Tom.

1074
01:19:20,926 --> 01:19:22,974
Look, I did not sign up
for this.

1075
01:19:23,007 --> 01:19:24,894
None of us did.

1076
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,622
So either you help me kill Tom

1077
01:19:26,654 --> 01:19:29,502
or I tell Clements
you're the snide.

1078
01:19:37,695 --> 01:19:39,934
Tom's girlfriend's on the train.

1079
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:18,494
(yells)

1080
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:35,199
(text alert)

1081
01:20:51,327 --> 01:20:52,894
(text alert)

1082
01:20:58,239 --> 01:20:59,871
Tom!

1083
01:20:59,903 --> 01:21:01,054
(text alert)

1084
01:21:12,447 --> 01:21:14,335
- (text alert)
- Tom!

1085
01:21:14,367 --> 01:21:16,926
Under train. Same as before.

1086
01:21:17,821 --> 01:21:19,966
Tom, it's a trap!

1087
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:54,655
Drop it.

1088
01:21:54,687 --> 01:21:55,839
(gun clatters)

1089
01:21:57,181 --> 01:21:58,367
(Tom) Sophie!

1090
01:21:58,398 --> 01:21:59,518
(Sophie) Tom.

1091
01:22:00,703 --> 01:22:03,358
Was it something I said?

1092
01:22:03,391 --> 01:22:05,758
She'd never
leave a casualty behind.

1093
01:22:06,878 --> 01:22:08,638
How sweet.
You know Sophie so well.

1094
01:22:10,047 --> 01:22:12,159
The only reason I'm down here
is because of her.

1095
01:22:12,190 --> 01:22:13,566
Sounds like the simplest thing

1096
01:22:13,598 --> 01:22:15,358
is to offer yourself up
in exchange.

1097
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,663
Then we'd have to
trust each other.

1098
01:22:21,246 --> 01:22:23,391
Let her go.

1099
01:22:23,423 --> 01:22:26,431
Once she's gone, so am I.

1100
01:22:39,581 --> 01:22:41,663
It's not in our nature.

1101
01:22:41,695 --> 01:22:44,575
We're more alike than you know.

1102
01:22:44,607 --> 01:22:47,166
I don't recall
torching any villages.

1103
01:22:47,198 --> 01:22:49,054
How many people have you killed?

1104
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:51,550
How many?

1105
01:22:55,678 --> 01:22:57,918
- I don't think about it.
- Neither do I.

1106
01:22:57,951 --> 01:23:01,630
Don't think about it.
Don't dream about it.

1107
01:23:01,662 --> 01:23:03,871
So he switches on
and he kills people.

1108
01:23:03,903 --> 01:23:06,462
And then he switches off
and he takes you to Paris.

1109
01:23:06,495 --> 01:23:08,607
- How romantic.
- I'll do it.

1110
01:23:21,694 --> 01:23:24,831
Well, there's only one way
to end this.

1111
01:23:33,503 --> 01:23:37,311
What are you doing, Tom?
What are you doing?

1112
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:44,958
- (gunshot)
- Tom!

1113
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:48,414
Run, Sophie, run!

1114
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:03,805
(gas hisses)

1115
01:24:13,534 --> 01:24:16,575
Shit.

1116
01:24:16,607 --> 01:24:18,591
(newsreader) <i>We're hearing
reports of an explosion</i>

1117
01:24:18,622 --> 01:24:21,631
<i>near to where a Eurostream
train was hijacked.</i>

1118
01:24:21,663 --> 01:24:24,222
<i>The SAS counterterror team
is at the scene,</i>

1119
01:24:24,255 --> 01:24:25,599
<i>and it's clear the situation</i>

1120
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:27,901
<i>has become
extremely dangerous now.</i>

1121
01:24:27,934 --> 01:24:29,790
ABC, CNN also transmitting.

1122
01:24:29,821 --> 01:24:32,062
Well, where the fuck
is Clements?

1123
01:24:32,895 --> 01:24:34,621
(computer chimes)

1124
01:24:36,927 --> 01:24:38,047
(SAS operator) Quiet!

1125
01:24:38,847 --> 01:24:39,934
Quiet down.

1126
01:24:39,967 --> 01:24:41,662
Answer it.

1127
01:24:44,863 --> 01:24:49,438
This is Sergeant Smith.
I'm the new ground commander.

1128
01:24:49,471 --> 01:24:50,367
What was that explosion?

1129
01:24:50,398 --> 01:24:52,255
<i>That was your man</i>

1130
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,390
<i>trying to rescue
his girlfriend.</i>

1131
01:24:55,423 --> 01:24:59,742
<i>Try that again and I'll torch
the entire tunnel.</i>

1132
01:25:01,822 --> 01:25:02,974
(clears throat)

1133
01:25:06,878 --> 01:25:09,694
Your money's ready for transfer.

1134
01:25:09,727 --> 01:25:11,614
Britgaz just confirmed it.

1135
01:25:11,647 --> 01:25:13,311
<i>I'll need an outside line</i>

1136
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:15,327
<i>to verify
that it's reached the account.</i>

1137
01:25:16,829 --> 01:25:18,303
Opening now.

1138
01:25:20,191 --> 01:25:22,655
Eurocopter is fueled
and standing by.

1139
01:25:24,991 --> 01:25:26,110
End the call.

1140
01:25:38,046 --> 01:25:41,182
- That's it. It's uncoupled?
- Yeah. Well done.

1141
01:25:41,215 --> 01:25:44,383
The passengers are consolidated
and we have the money.

1142
01:25:44,414 --> 01:25:47,134
Wire everyone their cut,
including Declan.

1143
01:25:52,094 --> 01:25:54,366
I was aiming for soft tissue.

1144
01:25:55,295 --> 01:25:56,830
What about the player?

1145
01:25:56,863 --> 01:25:59,710
It'll take too long to put
the fire out and confirm him.

1146
01:25:59,743 --> 01:26:02,431
We should assume
he's still in the battle space.

1147
01:26:02,463 --> 01:26:04,062
Come on.

1148
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:16,063
Right, Olivia, set up
our control point over there.

1149
01:26:16,094 --> 01:26:18,270
Yeah, boss, I'm on it.

1150
01:26:18,302 --> 01:26:19,455
I've got three sniper positions

1151
01:26:19,486 --> 01:26:20,734
and my team's
looking for one more.

1152
01:26:20,767 --> 01:26:22,527
- Right.
- Hey.

1153
01:26:22,558 --> 01:26:24,574
You know, I can drop all of 'em
before they get to the heli.

1154
01:26:24,607 --> 01:26:26,302
Just give me the word.

1155
01:26:26,335 --> 01:26:28,414
Tom'll have his day.

1156
01:26:30,398 --> 01:26:32,670
Dec. You alright?

1157
01:26:32,702 --> 01:26:35,838
- Yeah, I'm fine. Course.
- Paddy.

1158
01:26:52,062 --> 01:26:53,886
I like your hoodie.

1159
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:56,895
Take it off.

1160
01:26:58,111 --> 01:26:59,453
Now.

1161
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:16,158
(Sophie) Help!

1162
01:27:17,118 --> 01:27:19,775
- (sobs)
- Shh!

1163
01:27:29,918 --> 01:27:32,255
Up you go.

1164
01:27:42,271 --> 01:27:44,222
<i>All call signs, this is Alpha.</i>

1165
01:27:44,254 --> 01:27:47,134
<i>The train is two minutes out.
Call the heli in.</i>

1166
01:27:47,167 --> 01:27:51,871
Papa 1-4, this is Alpha.
All clear. Call in now.

1167
01:27:51,902 --> 01:27:55,455
(pilot) <i>Papa 1-4.
Roger that. On approach.</i>

1168
01:28:12,926 --> 01:28:14,655
Put the fucking mask on.

1169
01:28:15,103 --> 01:28:16,415
Move!

1170
01:28:32,126 --> 01:28:33,118
Gas.

1171
01:28:33,151 --> 01:28:34,846
(Olly) Get inside.

1172
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:38,494
(bleeping)

1173
01:28:38,526 --> 01:28:40,638
Setting the anti-tamper
triggers now.

1174
01:28:53,374 --> 01:28:55,294
(Olly) Wait.

1175
01:28:55,327 --> 01:28:56,318
OK.

1176
01:28:56,350 --> 01:28:57,822
(grunts)

1177
01:29:07,262 --> 01:29:08,798
Come on, get in.

1178
01:29:10,335 --> 01:29:11,518
Get in.

1179
01:29:11,551 --> 01:29:14,142
Olly, get the other sled.

1180
01:29:16,126 --> 01:29:17,726
Sophie!

1181
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:19,902
Go.

1182
01:29:21,374 --> 01:29:23,710
I'll take care of him.

1183
01:29:25,534 --> 01:29:27,294
Dad would be proud.

1184
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:43,839
(alarm blares)

1185
01:30:18,718 --> 01:30:20,702
(gasps)

1186
01:30:32,062 --> 01:30:35,742
(Declan) <i>All call signs,
Alpha has Eurostream.</i>

1187
01:30:35,775 --> 01:30:38,686
<i>That's the cockpit unmanned.
On autopilot.</i>

1188
01:30:38,718 --> 01:30:41,342
<i>Slowing. Slowing.</i>

1189
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:43,838
Slowing.

1190
01:30:45,470 --> 01:30:47,582
Stop. That's Eurostream static.

1191
01:30:52,478 --> 01:30:56,062
If you have Grace,
take the shot.

1192
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:01,790
I thought she had safe passage.

1193
01:31:01,822 --> 01:31:02,974
Change of plan.

1194
01:31:03,006 --> 01:31:06,302
<i>If you can target her,
take the shot.</i>

1195
01:31:08,734 --> 01:31:11,486
This is Alpha.

1196
01:31:11,518 --> 01:31:13,471
All Sierras stand by.

1197
01:31:13,502 --> 01:31:15,422
We're gonna drop the Swans.

1198
01:31:19,135 --> 01:31:21,854
Stand by. Stand by.
Possible Swans in Coach 19.

1199
01:31:21,886 --> 01:31:25,054
(sniper) <i>Sierra 5.
Swans, Coach 19. Confirmed.</i>

1200
01:31:25,086 --> 01:31:27,326
(Black Swan)
Remember what we agreed.

1201
01:31:27,358 --> 01:31:32,863
Do what I say when I say
and we all get to go home.

1202
01:31:32,895 --> 01:31:34,206
(phone bleeps)

1203
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:38,974
Now, get your hoods up.

1204
01:31:52,414 --> 01:31:54,399
(Declan) <i>All call signs,
this is Alpha.</i>

1205
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:56,542
<i>That's the hostages
exiting the Eurostream.</i>

1206
01:31:56,575 --> 01:31:59,294
<i>Sierra call signs,
we need eyes on Grace.</i>

1207
01:31:59,326 --> 01:32:01,406
<i>Eyes on Grace.</i>

1208
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:08,351
<i>All call signs,
is Grace sighted?</i>

1209
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:18,879
<i>Sierra call signs, I repeat,
does anyone have eyes on Grace?</i>

1210
01:32:18,911 --> 01:32:21,374
(sniper) <i>Sierra 5.
Grace unsighted.</i>

1211
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:24,382
<i>Possible Swan. Blue on black.</i>

- Unsighted.

1217

1230
01:33:57,598 --> 01:33:59,518

1236
01:34:27,262 --> 01:34:29,790

Grace unsighted.</i>

1237

<i>I say again, Grace unsighted.</i>

1238
01:34:31,838 --> 01:34:35,838
Looks like Grace
did a runner. Again.

1239
01:34:35,870 --> 01:34:37,790
You fucking snide.

1240
01:34:45,150 --> 01:34:46,750

1246
01:35:16,926 --> 01:35:19,134
Killing me won't stop Tom.

1247
01:35:20,350 --> 01:35:22,079
Perhaps this will.

1248
01:35:22,111 --> 01:35:24,063
(screams)

1249
01:35:30,526 --> 01:35:32,286
Sophie.

1250
01:35:32,318 --> 01:35:35,101
Don't worry.
This will stop the bleeding.

1251
01:35:36,318 --> 01:35:37,439
Pull.

1252
01:35:38,623 --> 01:35:41,726
Tom, drop her.

1253
01:35:44,255 --> 01:35:46,526
- What?
- Tom...

1254
01:35:48,255 --> 01:35:50,015
I understand.

1255
01:35:53,310 --> 01:35:54,815
Drop her.

1256
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:58,655
Go.

1257
01:36:24,030 --> 01:36:25,182
(Declan groans)

1258
01:36:25,214 --> 01:36:26,335
Shit.

1259
01:36:34,686 --> 01:36:38,398
You. You've got
a decision to make.

1260
01:36:40,894 --> 01:36:44,286
Choose wisely
and I'll help you sort this out.

1261
01:36:44,318 --> 01:36:46,110
(laughs)

1262
01:36:48,990 --> 01:36:53,279
Mate, I've seen the way
you sort things out.

1263
01:36:53,311 --> 01:36:55,103
You don't give a shit
about anyone,

1264
01:36:55,135 --> 01:36:57,661
let alone a fucking snide.

1265
01:36:57,694 --> 01:37:00,831
I give enough of a shit
to find you.

1266
01:37:00,863 --> 01:37:02,847
And fucking kill you.

1267
01:37:02,879 --> 01:37:08,543
Yeah, well, when the world finds
out what you've been up to,

1268
01:37:08,575 --> 01:37:11,647
they'll be coming after you,
not me.

1269
01:37:14,367 --> 01:37:16,062

1320
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:19,295
Always have.

1321

If you were to drop me
right now,

1322
01:42:23,743 --> 01:42:25,598
would you think twice about it?

No.

1324

I'm the same way.

1325

It's a gift.

1326
01:42:47,999 --> 01:42:50,079
A gift we both share.

1327
01:42:52,926 --> 01:42:55,102
A gift?

1328
01:42:55,135 --> 01:42:57,790
I reckon most people
wouldn't see it that way.

1329
01:42:57,822 --> 01:43:00,798
Most people are weak
and filled with doubt.

1330
01:43:01,695 --> 01:43:03,325
Maybe.

1331
01:43:04,063 --> 01:43:05,758
But they still...

1332
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:09,438
They still deserve...

01:43:10,718 --> 01:43:12,382
(laughs)

1334
01:43:13,246 --> 01:43:14,910
Love?

1335
01:43:14,942 --> 01:43:16,799
I've never loved anyone
in my entire life,

1336
01:43:16,830 --> 01:43:17,982
and neither have you.

1337
01:43:19,966 --> 01:43:21,566
That's not true.

1338
01:43:22,782 --> 01:43:24,062
Not any more.

1339
01:43:24,094 --> 01:43:29,758
Tom, Sophie will eventually
leave you.

1340
01:43:29,791 --> 01:43:32,446
'Cause she will never understand
who you really are.

1341
01:43:32,478 --> 01:43:34,591
She understands now.

1342

You...

1343
01:43:40,222 --> 01:43:43,038
are rare, and special.

Let me help you embrace
who you really are.

1345
01:43:48,735 --> 01:43:50,878
A true Black Swan.

1346
01:43:57,246 --> 01:43:58,687
You're right.

1347
01:44:00,638 --> 01:44:02,271
I am.

1348
01:45:24,991 --> 01:45:26,750
You OK?

1349
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:39,487
If you ever wanna
talk about it up here...

1350
01:45:43,262 --> 01:45:48,446
Actually, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

1351
01:46:04,926 --> 01:46:07,038
Is that why you wanted
to go to Paris?

1352
01:46:07,998 --> 01:46:09,310
Will you marry me?

1353
01:46:22,495 --> 01:46:25,119
If I thought
I could make you happy, I would.

1354
01:46:27,518 --> 01:46:29,182
But, Tom...

1355
01:46:30,206 --> 01:46:32,254
you're not meant to be married.

1356
01:46:33,310 --> 01:46:35,646
I know that now, and so do you.

1357
01:46:43,742 --> 01:46:46,078
- I thought you understood.
- I do.

1358
01:47:05,822 --> 01:47:07,198
Sophie...

1359
01:47:11,646 --> 01:47:13,342
Oh, my...

1360
01:47:15,134 --> 01:47:16,798
Are you...?

1361
01:47:18,814 --> 01:47:20,862
It's news to me as well.

1362
01:47:29,886 --> 01:47:33,791
I love you.
Please, marry me.

01:48:21,150 --> 01:48:22,783
<i>have called him a hero
for what they say</i>

1384
01:48:22,815 --> 01:48:25,310
<i>is his battle against
institutional corruption.</i>

1385
01:48:25,342 --> 01:48:27,806
<i>They've repeated the claim,
first made by Grace Lewis,</i>

1386
01:48:27,838 --> 01:48:29,503
<i>that it was
the British government</i>

1387
01:48:29,535 --> 01:48:31,870
<i>that ordered a massacre
in the Republic of Georgia</i>

1388
01:48:31,902 --> 01:48:34,046
<i>to pave the way
for a gas pipeline.</i>

1389
01:48:34,078 --> 01:48:36,606
(newsreader 2) <i>Britgaz, one of
the UK's largest corporations,</i>

1390
01:48:36,638 --> 01:48:38,111
<i>has denied those allegations</i>

1391
01:48:38,143 --> 01:48:40,991
<i>and expressed its sympathy
for all the victims.</i>

1392
01:48:41,023 --> 01:48:42,750
<i>Its chairman,
Sir Charles Whiteside,</i>

1393
01:48:42,782 --> 01:48:45,182
<i>had refused to make any further
comment until today,</i>

1394
01:48:45,214 --> 01:48:49,214
<i>when he phoned in to our studio
for this exclusive interview.</i>

1395
01:48:49,246 --> 01:48:50,462
<i>Sir Charles,
what's your response</i>

1396
01:48:50,494 --> 01:48:52,030
<i>to the Grace Lewis video,</i>

1397
01:48:52,062 --> 01:48:53,758
<i>which implies
Britgaz was willing</i>

1398
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:55,742
<i>to pay the perpetrators
for their silence?</i>

1399
01:48:55,774 --> 01:48:57,343
(Sir Charles) <i>Clearly
the video was constructed</i>

1400
01:48:57,375 --> 01:48:59,742
<i>by this Grace Lewis
in a pathetic attempt</i>

1401
01:48:59,774 --> 01:49:01,982
<i>to deflect attention
from her crimes.</i>

1402
01:49:02,014 --> 01:49:03,838
(newsreader 2) <i>So you'd support
a full investigation</i>

1403
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:05,790
<i>into the attack
and these claims?</i>

1404
01:49:05,822 --> 01:49:08,254
(Sir Charles) <i>Yes, as it would
reveal the inconvenient truth:</i>

1405
01:49:08,286 --> 01:49:10,462
<i>our own security services
were betrayed,</i>

1406
01:49:10,495 --> 01:49:12,671
<i>and this led to a tragic
loss of life and property.</i>

1407
01:49:12,703 --> 01:49:14,302
(newsreader 2)
<i>Are you referring</i>

1408
01:49:14,335 --> 01:49:16,190
<i>to former SAS commander
Declan Smith?</i>

1409
01:49:16,222 --> 01:49:18,367
(Sir Charles) <i>I'm aware that
a Red Notice has been issued</i>

1410
01:49:18,399 --> 01:49:19,966
<i>for a man by that name,</i>

1411
01:49:19,998 --> 01:49:22,046
<i>and I look forward
to seeing justice done.</i>

1412
01:49:22,078 --> 01:49:24,030
(newsreader 2) <i>Victims
of the Eurostream attack</i>

1413
01:49:24,062 --> 01:49:26,430

01:49:26,462 --> 01:49:29,726
<i>on a private yacht or villa

1415
01:49:29,758 --> 01:49:30,943

(newsreader 2) <i>Fallout from

<i>that brought down
the Channel Tunnel</i>

1436

<i>to complete disappointment</i>

(Sophie) I, Dr Sophie Hart,

1453
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:59,806
take thee,
Thomas William Buckingham III,

1454
01:50:59,838 --> 01:51:02,590
to be
my lawfully wedded husband,

1455
01:51:02,622 --> 01:51:05,502
to have and to hold
from this day forward,

1456
01:51:06,398 --> 01:51:08,350
for better, for worse,

1457
01:51:08,382 --> 01:51:10,719
in war and peace,

1458
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:16,479
knowing that in war, your crazy
brain is always right.

1459
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:20,223
And I will never wonder what
you get up to in the loo again.

1460
01:51:20,255 --> 01:51:22,526
Trust me,
you don't want to know.

1461
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:31,358
I, Thomas William
Buckingham III,

1462
01:51:31,390 --> 01:51:34,078
take thee, Dr Sophie Hart,

1463
01:51:34,110 --> 01:51:35,551
to be my lawfully wedded wife,

1464
01:51:35,583 --> 01:51:39,134

1467
01:51:43,102 --> 01:51:48,190
knowing that in peace your
prognosis will always be right.

1468
01:51:48,223 --> 01:51:49,855
Also I'll never freeze
your dead cat again.

1469
01:51:49,887 --> 01:51:52,030
A very wise decision, sir.

1470
01:52:03,966 --> 01:52:06,781
By the power vested in me
by the local mayor,

1471
01:52:06,814 --> 01:52:10,877
who you generously supported
in his re-election campaign,

1472
01:52:10,910 --> 01:52:13,983
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1473
01:52:14,847 --> 01:52:16,703
You may kiss the bride.

1474
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:21,150
(phone rings)

1475
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:24,447
Oh, fuck.

1476
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:26,623
Took him long enough.

1477
01:52:26,655 --> 01:52:28,766
Go on, then.

1478
01:52:30,495 --> 01:52:32,063
Yes, boss?

1479
01:52:32,095 --> 01:52:34,590
(Clements) <i>Are you married yet
or what?</i>

1480
01:52:34,621 --> 01:52:38,398
- Just.
- <i>It'll all end in tears.</i>

1481
01:52:38,430 --> 01:52:40,030
I'll give your love
to the missus.

1482
01:52:40,063 --> 01:52:43,230
<i>Hey, I've got a wedding present
for you.</i>

1483
01:52:45,214 --> 01:52:46,430
You found the money.

1484
01:52:46,463 --> 01:52:48,511
<i>Right where
you thought it'd be.</i>

1485
01:52:49,343 --> 01:52:50,431
And Declan?

1486
01:52:50,463 --> 01:52:52,798
<i>That cunt is sitting on it.</i>

1487
01:52:53,918 --> 01:52:55,135
Alright, stand by.

1488
01:52:57,886 --> 01:53:00,606
Wanna take a rain check
on the honeymoon?

1489
01:53:00,638 --> 01:53:02,911
Yeah.

1490
01:53:02,943 --> 01:53:04,959
Drop him.

1491
01:53:04,990 --> 01:53:06,430
You sure?

1492
01:53:06,462 --> 01:53:09,374
I never liked
that little fucker.

1493
01:53:14,237 --> 01:53:15,901
Drop him.

1494
01:53:22,718 --> 01:53:24,478
(Sophie laughs)
