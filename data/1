Don't shoot!

Yeah, all right.

16
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,318
Gentleman.

17
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,147
- We have to talk.

18
00:03:38,494 --> 00:03:40,150
The Canadians.

19
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:42,705
Their kid got snagged
at the border.

20
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:43,533
- What, the courier?

21
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:44,396
- Cedric.

22
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:45,570
He's all over the news.

23
00:03:45,604 --> 00:03:46,743
- Jesus.

24
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:47,986
- How the fuck did that happen?

25
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,195
- We don't know how
the fuck that happened.

26
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,472
But apparently
there's a great amount

27
00:03:51,507 --> 00:03:53,992
of anxiety bouncing around now.

28
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:55,269
- Where are they
holding the kid?

29
00:03:55,304 --> 00:03:57,375
- [Minas] Montreal
detention center.

30
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:58,962
- Maybe I know
someone inside there.

31
00:03:58,997 --> 00:04:01,413
- Should this Cedric get
an itch to name names-

32
00:04:01,448 --> 00:04:03,519
- No, he's not gonna
name any fucking names.

33
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:06,591

be unpleasant for everyone.

- What the fuck?
- What?

39
00:05:10,517 --> 00:05:11,414
- I've been in there
for half an hour.

40
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:12,691
- Yeah, there was traffic.

41
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:13,830
- Did you recycle at
the Conway off-ramp?

42
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,073
- Yeah, are you
getting paranoid again?

43
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,971
- Don't start with
that paranoid shit.

44
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:17,903
- Jesus.

45
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:19,457
Sorry, okay?
- Drive better.

46
00:05:19,491 --> 00:05:21,562
- I'll do my level best.

47
00:05:21,597 --> 00:05:22,908
- I'll be back in an hour.

48
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:32,746
- Hey.

49
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,678
- Hey.

50
00:05:33,712 --> 00:05:35,162
- Your sister's in the TV room.

51
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:36,025

[indistinct]

56
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,317
- Hey, small fry.

57
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:57,322
Doctor said you got 19 days.

58
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:01,878
I'm almost finished
with my deal.

59
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:03,880
And I figure when we're done,

60
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:06,262
we can go for a
drive up to the lake.

61
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,127
We can have breakfast.

62
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:15,236
I mean, fuck, we could
even bring Mom. [chuckles]

63
00:06:18,723 --> 00:06:19,620
What do you think?

00:06:26,247 --> 00:06:28,629
[slow music]

65
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:32,426
She's taking methadone?
- Yes.

66
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:34,532
- [Jake] Anything else?

67
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:35,774
- [Doctor] Mild sedatives.

68
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:36,982
She was violent.

69
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:38,950
And there's some hearing loss,

70
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:41,366
about 40% in her right ear.

71
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,574
Hopefully it'll stop.

72
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:45,612
- Why's that happening?

73
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:46,509
- [Doctor] We don't know.

74
00:06:46,544 --> 00:06:48,269
We see it sometimes.

75
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:51,169
We think the opiates damage
the nerves in the ear canals.

76
00:07:05,114 --> 00:07:07,219
- I'm... Claire.

77
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:08,462
I'm an addict.

78
00:07:09,498 --> 00:07:11,776
Drug of choice, oxy.

79
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,469
Um, I heard Ron talking
about doctor shopping

80
00:07:15,504 --> 00:07:17,575
and it brought back
some nice memories.

81
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:21,337
Not as good as
the memory of, um,

82
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:24,478
this one time when I
really needed a fix

83
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:28,724
and my doctor wouldn't write
me any scripts anymore.

84
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:29,932
And uh,

85
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:34,937
I still had the cast from
my original accident,

86
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:38,630
so I put my wrist in
the car door and I,

87
00:07:41,357 --> 00:07:43,980
so I could, you
know, get a script.

88
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:48,364
I have an amazing
16-year-old son

89
00:07:48,398 --> 00:07:51,574
and I can't even sit through
a hockey game without...

90
00:07:54,715 --> 00:07:56,027
Without thinking about it.

91
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,997
I would like to be a
better person for him,

92
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:05,208
and I am working
on that every day.

95
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:18,981
Did you bring the slip?

96
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:20,810
- I did.
- Come here.

97
00:08:20,845 --> 00:08:22,467
- How are you?
- How was school?

98
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,089
- Pretty good.
- Good.

99
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:26,713
Thank you.

100
00:08:29,578 --> 00:08:32,408
All right, um, your aunt's
coming over for dinner tonight,

101
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:34,099
so on your way
home from practice,

102
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:36,136
can you please stop by the store

103
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,862
and pick up some tortillas?

104
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:39,311
I'm gonna make fajitas tonight.

105
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:40,692
- Oh, you're cooking?

106
00:08:40,727 --> 00:08:41,935
- Are you teasing?

107
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,177
- You say you're
ordering a pizza?

108
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:44,489
What did you say?
[Claire laughs]

109
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,352
I'll get them.

110
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:49,252
- Thank you.
- Love you.

111
00:08:49,287 --> 00:08:50,357
- I love you.

112
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:02,783
- With our product, Klaralon,

113
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:04,889
we never cross the
blood-brain barrier,

114
00:09:04,923 --> 00:09:09,445
so we block the receptors from
the reinforcement mechanism

115
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:13,518
and this greatly diminishes
possibility of addiction.

116
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:18,903
A patient takes one
dose twice a day

117
00:09:18,937 --> 00:09:21,284
and the incidence of
addictive behavior

118
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:23,804
is less than a quarter
that of oxycodone.

119
00:09:25,185 --> 00:09:29,638
Klaralon will be the first
truly non-addictive painkiller.

120
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:34,228
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the holy grail.

121
00:09:34,263 --> 00:09:37,024
So, let's drink from the cup.

122
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:39,509
[applauding]

123
00:09:43,652 --> 00:09:45,930
- And what's been
forgotten today,

124
00:09:45,964 --> 00:09:48,518
in our rush to judgment,

125
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:52,005
is that in the field
of observation,

126
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,870
chance favors the prepared mind.

127
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:56,768
Now, who said that?

128
00:09:56,803 --> 00:09:59,633
Uh, Alexandra.

129
00:09:59,668 --> 00:10:00,841
- Louis Pasteur.

130
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:02,843
- Louis Pasteur, he
said that, yes indeed.

131
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:04,362
And he lived it.

132
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:09,332
For 30 years, he worked in
pursuit of a singular goal.

133
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:12,301
Now, many will tell
you that anyone

134
00:10:12,335 --> 00:10:14,924
who works for 30 years on
anything without results

135
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,134
is uh, [laughs] insane.

136
00:10:18,169 --> 00:10:21,966
But isn't the very
definition of insanity here

137
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,278
just another word for focus?

138
00:10:24,313 --> 00:10:26,660
Because without us crazies,

139
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,628
I mean, where
would the world be?

140
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:29,974
[students laughing]

141
00:10:30,008 --> 00:10:33,080
Okay, what is next?

142
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,151
No, I understand that, Bill.

143
00:10:35,186 --> 00:10:37,326
I just wanna double check
our results here for you,

144
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,879
make sure nothing is off.

145
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:40,881
- I'm sure your work
is good as usual,

146
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,401
but you know, we're really
getting behind here.

147
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,092
- Just, just bear with me.

148
00:10:45,127 --> 00:10:46,369
Everything will be fine.

149
00:10:46,404 --> 00:10:48,302
- Look, we've given
you a lot of business

150
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:50,580
over the years, Tyrone, and
you always come through,

151
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,825
but if you want me to
call David Nunez at UCLA

152
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,689
and ask him to pick up
some of the testing work-

153
00:10:55,724 --> 00:10:57,587
- No, no, no, there's
no need for that.

154
00:10:57,622 --> 00:10:59,728
I promise, Bill,
it will be ready.

155
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:04,008
Hey, Reeva.
- Hey.

156
00:11:04,042 --> 00:11:06,286
- Do you have the results
from the Northlight study?

157
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,528
- Yeah, I'm sorry, Doctor.

158
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:08,840
I'm just double checking them.

159
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,704
They should be ready by tonight.

160
00:11:10,739 --> 00:11:12,154
- Is everything
all right with it?

161
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,051
- Yeah.

162
00:11:13,086 --> 00:11:14,846
Well, I'll know shortly.

163
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:17,607
- Okay, well, let me know
as soon as it's done.

164
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:22,785
- Now, new GS is up from
Washington, name of Garrett.

165
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,649
She wants a full report.

166
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,444
- So, what, you couldn't
explain it to her?

167
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:28,549
- I could, but she wanted
the agent in charge.

168
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,310
That's you, isn't it?

169
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:32,001
- What's happening, fellas?
- How you living, Slim?

170
00:11:32,036 --> 00:11:33,347
- Oh, can't complain.

171
00:11:33,382 --> 00:11:34,348
- So, what's the deal?

172
00:11:34,383 --> 00:11:35,902
You know anyone who's
worked with her before?

173
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,800
- Yeah, me, actually, back
when I was in Virginia.

174
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:38,870
- You did?
[rock music]

175
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:39,837
Doing what?

176
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:40,803
- Well, she was a field agent

177
00:11:40,838 --> 00:11:42,494
before she became a supervisor.

178
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:43,737
- Field agent?

179
00:11:43,772 --> 00:11:45,256
Thought you've always
been a desk jockey.

180
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,533

him to WITSEC.

355
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:40,093
He's gonna testify
he was smuggling

356
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:42,233
on behalf of the
Montreal syndicate.

357
00:17:42,268 --> 00:17:43,993
And that means Mother.

358
00:17:44,028 --> 00:17:45,236
- Fuck.

359
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:46,341
That means it's only
a matter of time

360
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,549
before Mother gets to him

361
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,275
and anyone else who
knew about this.

362
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,554
- Yeah, Jake, you really
think this is realistic?

363
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,038
I mean, the Montreal piece.

364
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,523
You're right, you don't
have a deep rep with Mother.

365
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:58,836
Maybe it's dangerous to
press a big sale now.

366
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:02,081
- Yeah, but what fucking
choice do we have?

367
00:18:06,913 --> 00:18:08,811
- [Cashier] I, I don't know.
- Seriously?

368
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,468
We need to find him.

369
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:11,814
- So many people
come through here.

370
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:13,782
- Yeah, so, somebody had
to have seen him, right?

371
00:18:13,816 --> 00:18:14,990
- Ma'am, I don't know.

372
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:16,164
- Yeah, I know you don't know,

373
00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:17,579
but somebody knows.
- Claire.

374
00:18:17,613 --> 00:18:18,511
- What?

375
00:18:18,545 --> 00:18:19,443
- You've gotta calm down.

376
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:20,651
- No, I'm not gonna calm down.

377
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:21,479
- Is everything all right here?

378
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:22,411
- No.

379
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:23,516
Everything's not all right.

380
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:27,899
I'm, I'm looking for my son.

381
00:18:27,934 --> 00:18:28,797
- All right, we wanna help.

382
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:29,763
We're gonna find him.

383
00:18:29,798 --> 00:18:30,488
All right?
- Thank you.

384
00:18:30,523 --> 00:18:31,351
Thank you.

385
00:18:32,214 --> 00:18:33,388
Sorry, I didn't...

386
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:34,216
Sorry.

387
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:38,117
[intense music]

388
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,164
[Tyrone sighs]

389
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,027
- Okay.

390
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:54,685
This is sugar water.

391
00:18:55,824 --> 00:18:57,066
And where's the drug?

392
00:18:57,101 --> 00:18:59,138
- This is 182 over here.

393
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:02,348
- Yeah.

394
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:05,351
I guess Northlight
hasn't quite cracked

395
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:07,076
that blood-brain issue yet, huh?

396
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:10,666
Eh, well, they'll
be disappointed.

397
00:19:10,701 --> 00:19:14,187
- Doctor, you asked us to
use Klaralon as a baseline.

398
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:16,085
- Yeah, yeah, it's
a good control.

399
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,261
- Well, we did, and we ran
it for 10 days as well.

400
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:25,854
- Uh.

401
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:28,512
I don't understand you, uh,

402
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:30,065
you ran 182 twice?

403
00:19:30,099 --> 00:19:33,241
- No, Doctor, this isn't 182.

404
00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:35,484
We gave these mice Klaralon.

405
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,624
This is Klaralon at day 10.

406
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,638
- What the hell is going on?

407
00:19:57,955 --> 00:20:01,234
- We were contracted
to do a 7-day study,

408
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,995
and I elected to use our
standard 10-day protocol

409
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,584
to yield a more
informative result.

410
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:09,725
Now, everything was fine
throughout the seventh day,

411
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,384
but on day eight, you can
see what started happening.

412
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:15,144
The mice keep seeking the drug.

413
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,802
They stay only in the
drug dispensing area.

414
00:20:17,837 --> 00:20:19,942
- Until they die.
- Exactly.

415
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:22,013
You can see from the fMRI scans

416
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:24,533
that all the addiction centers

417
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:26,880
in their brains are lighting up.

418
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:30,263
And then by day
10, they're dead.

419
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:33,680
That goes for P182 and Klaralon.

420
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,650
- This can't be right.

421
00:20:37,684 --> 00:20:39,168
- Apart from the extra
days of experiment,

422
00:20:39,203 --> 00:20:40,549
everything ran
according to protocol.

423
00:20:40,584 --> 00:20:42,310
- Well, then run it again.

424
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:44,795
We can't afford to deliver
an unprofessional result.

425
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,348
- I'm sorry, unprofessional?

426
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:47,625
- Northlight is already into

427
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,110
the final stage of human
trials with Klaralon.

428
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:53,528
We're just looking into
their new formulation.

429
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:55,530
There's no way
Klaralon is this toxic,

430
00:20:55,564 --> 00:20:57,946
it's about to be
approved by the FDA!

431
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,327
- We followed the
protocol exactly.

432
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:00,397
- Then recheck it.

433
00:21:01,398 --> 00:21:03,020
Everything!

434
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,092
The drug, the mice.

435
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:07,887
Even the damn cages.

436
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:11,546
Contract research
covers all our funding.

437
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,928
If word gets out that we
don't know what we're doing,

438
00:21:14,963 --> 00:21:17,828
we're, we're done,
we're finished.

439
00:21:17,862 --> 00:21:19,278
- Of course, Doctor.

440
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:21,349
We ran a standard
replicate study

441
00:21:21,383 --> 00:21:22,660
and it'll be ready
with you first thing.

442
00:21:22,695 --> 00:21:23,799
- Great.

443
00:21:23,834 --> 00:21:25,767
And call me as soon as.

444
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:31,980
- There.

445
00:21:32,014 --> 00:21:33,153
That's him right there.

446
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:35,949
- [Manager] That's 5:21 p.m.

447
00:21:35,984 --> 00:21:38,227
Uh, looks like he
bought some tortillas,

448
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:39,919
hot sauce, paid cash.
- Yeah.

449
00:21:42,473 --> 00:21:44,648
- Can you follow him outside?

450
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:48,790
- He exited through
the south door,

451
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:51,206
got on his bike,
looks like, and then.

452
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:54,761
- And then what?

453
00:21:55,659 --> 00:21:57,212
- I'm afraid that's it.

454
00:21:57,246 --> 00:21:58,834
There's only one camera on
that side of the building.

455
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:01,147
[phone vibrating]

456
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:02,010
- Hello?

457
00:22:04,978 --> 00:22:05,807
That's fine.

458
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,637
- What's fine?
- Okay, we'll come now.

459
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:10,294
Let's go.

460
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,192
They just, um, they-
- What?

461
00:22:14,505 --> 00:22:16,196
- [Police On Radio] Unit
26, this is central.

462
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:18,751
2-11 in progress, the
corner of Cass and Henry.

463
00:22:18,785 --> 00:22:20,373
Suspect is a male black-
- What is it?

464
00:22:20,408 --> 00:22:21,270
What's going on?

465
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:23,756
- Are you Ms. Reimann?
- Please tell me

466
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,345
what's going on.
- She's Claire Reimann.

467
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:28,070
- I'm afraid there's
been an accident.

468
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,625
Your son, David.
- Yeah.

469
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,766
- [Officer] He's gone, ma'am.

470
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,805
- What?

471
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,462
What do you mean?

472
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:41,463
He's gone where?

473
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:43,500
- He's dead.

474
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:45,985
I'm sorry.

- Wanna drink something?

482
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,272

- Wait for the beer.

[muffled rock music]

489
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:32,781
The way I see it, the
question before us is, why?

490
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:34,921
Why was the boy
stopped at the border?

491
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:38,822
And the logical answer is,
someone knew he was crossing.

492
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:40,237
Now, who knew that?

493
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,997
Your people knew that.

494
00:24:42,032 --> 00:24:43,240
- My guys wouldn't talk.

495
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,727
- Well, somebody
had to tip this off.

496
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:51,144
It's an unpatrolled stretch
of our southern border.

497
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,457
Can't be caught
without informant.

498
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,941
- But, Mother, my associates,

499
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:57,357
and you've met them,
they're Armenian.

500
00:24:57,392 --> 00:24:59,808
They would rather die
than talk to the police.

501
00:25:01,361 --> 00:25:02,777
- Look, Jake, I like you.

502
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:04,986
You've been a good customer,

503
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,160
buying a little
batch here, there,

504
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:08,541
but this larger plan now

505
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:11,061
seems to be beyond
your capabilities.

506
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,959
These boys, they
worked well for us

507
00:25:12,994 --> 00:25:14,374

508
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:15,997
Now we have a bust.

509

they're pressuring.

510
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,448
- Okay, I agree.

511
00:25:19,483 --> 00:25:20,691
Things haven't necessarily
gone smoothy so far, but-

512
00:25:20,726 --> 00:25:22,348
- Smooth?

513
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:23,591

[Mother speaking French]

515
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:27,836

keep your head down,

00:25:27,871 --> 00:25:29,113
focus on what you know.

517
00:25:30,874 --> 00:25:32,427

518

My guys run trucks through
the entire United States.

519
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:38,606
So, you take the
product to a warehouse,

520
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,849
you package it as vitamins,

521
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:44,232
then they come in their
trucks and pick it up.

522
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:47,131
- Well, tell me,
what's gonna happen

523
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,547
when they get to customs?

524
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:50,963
- NAFTA.

525
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:53,448
You take it to a
Foreign Trade Zone

526
00:25:53,482 --> 00:25:55,346
where the police
can't do inspections,

527
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:57,383
only customs agents can,

528
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:58,626
and they're not gonna open

529
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,282
every single bottle
of sealed vitamins.

President Reagan used to say,

00:26:07,082 --> 00:26:08,359
we must verify.

532
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:11,949
We must learn why it did happen.

533
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:13,917
[Guy speaking French]

534
00:26:13,951 --> 00:26:15,712
- Oui.

535
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:17,679
We're gonna talk to
our guy at customs.

536
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:23,547
- It's right there.

537
00:26:45,189 --> 00:26:46,639
- [Doctor] You sure?

538
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:47,502
- Yeah.

539
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:58,651
[gasps]
[slow music]

540
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:11,112
- [sobbing] Oh, god.

541
00:27:11,146 --> 00:27:13,079
- We won't have
toxicology for a few days,

542
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,841
but a paramedic in the alley
said it was an overdose.

543
00:27:16,738 --> 00:27:17,601
Oxycodone.

544
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:20,915
- What?

545
00:27:20,949 --> 00:27:21,847
- [Detective Carson] He
was foaming at the mouth

546
00:27:21,881 --> 00:27:23,365
when they arrived.

547
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,402
They tried Narcan to revive
him, but it was too late.

548
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,372
Were you aware of any
issues with your son?

549
00:27:30,407 --> 00:27:31,442
- [Claire] Like what?

550
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:32,547
- Drug issues.
- No.

551
00:27:34,998 --> 00:27:36,689
Absolutely not.

552
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:38,346
- Any idea where
he would get pills?

553
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,625
- Uh, my, my sister had
an accident a while ago.

554
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,799
- Sue.

555
00:27:42,833 --> 00:27:43,385
- And there were some
painkillers lying-

556
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,628
- Sue.

557
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,836
- There were some
painkillers around.

558
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:47,389
- Those pills have
been gone for months.

559
00:27:47,424 --> 00:27:49,357
- [Detective Carson] Sometimes
children steal these pills.

560
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:51,842
- David wasn't doing
drugs, I would've known.

561
00:27:51,877 --> 00:27:53,050
- [Detective Carson]
I understand.

562
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:54,811
Is it a single parent household?

563
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:56,295
- What are you getting at?

564
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:57,537
Just come out and say it to me.

565
00:27:57,572 --> 00:28:00,195
Otherwise what are
you gonna do about it?

566
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,508
- We're gonna continue
to monitor the situation.

567
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:03,992
- And?

568
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:05,166
- [Detective Carson] And
see if anything comes up.

569
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,408
- What does that mean?
- I, I, Claire-

570
00:28:06,443 --> 00:28:07,340
- No, what does that...

571
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:08,514
What the fuck does that mean,

572
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:09,722
see if anything comes up?

573
00:28:09,757 --> 00:28:11,344
Are you out there looking?

574
00:28:11,379 --> 00:28:13,519
I'm sorry, I love you so much.

575
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:16,004
- [Detective Carson]
Right now the department

576
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,075
is treating this as
an accidental death.

577
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,836
- Accidental?

578
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,596
You don't even
know what happened.

579
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:25,393
- Ms. Reimann, we have
40 overdoses this week,

580
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:27,119
here in Detroit alone.

581
00:28:27,153 --> 00:28:28,914
That's more than homicides.

582
00:28:28,948 --> 00:28:31,226
This isn't anything
against your son.

583
00:28:31,261 --> 00:28:32,400
It's a terrible drug.

584
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:34,402
I'm sorry.

585
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:38,613
We have his belongings for you.

586
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:40,339
We just need you
to sign for them.

587
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:44,308
[slow intense music]

588
00:29:23,934 --> 00:29:25,971
- [Reeva] So, this is the
replicate study I brought in,

589
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:28,490
and it shows exactly
the same result.

590
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,009
- Biological explanation?

591
00:29:30,044 --> 00:29:33,116
- We'd need a mass spec to see
how the liver's metabolizing,

592
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,394
not to mention many
more basic experiments.

593
00:29:35,428 --> 00:29:37,361
- We're talking six
months of work at least.

594
00:29:37,396 --> 00:29:40,364
- Mm, that's not gonna
fly with Northlight.

595
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:42,781
[sighs]

596
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,300
Something in the drug is
crossing the blood-brain barrier

597
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:46,992
and hitting the reward centers,

598
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:51,548
but Klaralon is supposed
to reduce dependence,

599
00:29:51,582 --> 00:29:53,274
not increase it threefold.

600
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:56,346
How could they not
have caught this?

601
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:59,314
Well, write up your findings.

602
00:29:59,349 --> 00:30:01,800
We should get this over
to Northlight right away.

603
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:17,574
- [Guy] How did the border
agents know to stop the boy?

604
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:18,437
- You tell me.

605
00:30:19,645 --> 00:30:21,958
- You're supposed to be
our ears of the patrols.

606
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:26,272
- I heard rumors.
- What?

607
00:30:29,724 --> 00:30:32,002
- Someone's talking,
in your house.

608
00:30:32,037 --> 00:30:33,452
[Guy scoffs]

609
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:35,730
- That's ridiculous.
[Fournier speaking French]

610
00:30:35,764 --> 00:30:36,765
- It's true.

611
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,594
There's a list.

612
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:40,597
- What list?

613
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:41,943
- And who are you?
- Never mind that.

614
00:30:41,978 --> 00:30:43,117
Answer the fucking question.
- Hey, whoa.

615
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:44,843
Whoa, relax.

616
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:46,741
You know a guy named Davison?

617
00:30:46,775 --> 00:30:50,227
The cop that was disgraced,
facing corruption charges?

618
00:30:50,262 --> 00:30:51,435
- [Guy] Yeah.

619
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,920
- When Internal
Affairs got onto him,

620
00:30:52,954 --> 00:30:55,612
they heard about a list he kept
at the major crimes bureau,

621
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:58,270
Over 200 names on it.

622
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:02,274
Every informant from every
crew he ever worked with.

623
00:31:02,308 --> 00:31:05,864
I bet that on that
list is your informant.

624
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,349
- Where's the list now?

625
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:09,626
- [Fournier] I heard
he's trying to sell it.

626
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,558
- Where?

627
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,973
- I'm just a custom inspector.

628
00:31:12,008 --> 00:31:13,699
Can't you find him?

629
00:31:13,733 --> 00:31:15,114
- All right, get out.

630
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:16,426
[Fournier speaking French]

631
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,532
Get the fuck out!
[groaning]

632
00:31:21,051 --> 00:31:23,674
See, I told you, he's garbage.

633
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:25,884
- We gotta find that list.

634
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:31,096
[slow music]

635
00:32:07,408 --> 00:32:10,066
[sighs heavily]

636
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,724
[sobbing]

637
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,040
[phone vibrating]

638
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:52,729
- [Meg Voicemail] Hi,
this is Dr. Meg Holmes.

639
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:53,902
Please leave a message.

640
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:57,596
- So, in recognition
of that great bounty,

641
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,392
our foundation is pleased
to announce tonight

642
00:33:00,426 --> 00:33:04,465
a five-year $30
million commitment

643
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:07,778
to the building of this
new contemporary art wing.

644
00:33:07,813 --> 00:33:10,229
[applauding]

645
00:33:12,956 --> 00:33:14,509
- Once FDA approves,

646
00:33:14,544 --> 00:33:18,513
we will bring Klaralon
to market in six months.

647
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:19,894
And in the spirit of gift giving

648
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:21,482
you demonstrated tonight,

649
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:24,002
here on page three are
the sales projections.

650
00:33:26,073 --> 00:33:27,660
- Wow, those are, uh...

651
00:33:27,695 --> 00:33:28,868
Wow.

652
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:31,871
- Physician response
is tremendous.

653
00:33:31,906 --> 00:33:33,528
- When our dad built Northlight,

654
00:33:33,563 --> 00:33:35,082
his dream was not
just to make money,

655
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:37,670
it was to make the
world a better place.

656
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:40,570
- An addiction-free painkiller
was always his goal,

657
00:33:40,604 --> 00:33:41,502
and you found it.

658
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:45,126
- You've done our
family proud, Meg.

659
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:48,026
- It was only possible through
your support, gentlemen.

660
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:51,477
I'm pleased we were
able to deliver for you.

661
00:33:51,512 --> 00:33:53,479
[phone vibrating]

662
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:54,446
- Will you excuse me?

663
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,343
- Of course.
- Sure.

664
00:33:57,794 --> 00:33:59,106
- Hello?

665
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,831
- [Bill On Phone]
Meg? It's Bill.

666
00:34:00,866 --> 00:34:01,832
We've got an issue.

667
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,943
- [Meg] How long has
he been a resource?

668
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:10,496
- Eight years.

669
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:12,671
He's always stamped whatever
we put in front of him.

670
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:14,086
- So where'd this come from?

671
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:18,332
- A mistake, apparently.

672
00:34:19,505 --> 00:34:21,059
As you can see, he
ran the study twice

673
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:22,232
with the same results.

674
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:24,269
I've been saying we take
it under advisement.

675
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:26,685
- But now Tyrone's
recommending we share his data

676
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,307
with a panel of scientists

677
00:34:28,342 --> 00:34:31,069
and present it at a
conference for further study?

678
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:32,794
I thought you were
on top of this.

679
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:35,935
- How do you wanna handle it?

680
00:34:43,357 --> 00:34:44,358
[rock music]

681
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:45,876
- Davison.

682
00:34:45,911 --> 00:34:47,533
Apparently he's in
a motel downtown

683
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:49,777
trying to make a
sale of the list.

684
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:51,503
$200k.

685
00:34:51,537 --> 00:34:54,402
- So, what's the move?
- I arranged a meet.

686
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:56,094
You guys go down there.

687
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,096
Motel Arlequin.

688
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,442
Room 206.

689
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:03,653
If the list is good, you buy it.

690
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,551
- For 200k?
- I front the money.

691
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:08,278
We can turn it around
to the other crews,

692
00:35:08,313 --> 00:35:09,383
make a profit, too.

693
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:12,834
- Or you can use the list to
eliminate your competition.

694
00:35:13,939 --> 00:35:15,872
- See, I told you he's smart.

695
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,943
You could learn
something from this man.

696
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:21,843
[Mother speaking French]

697
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:23,535
- I'll be by your
hotel tomorrow.

698
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:27,849
- Google's made
it more difficult

699
00:35:27,884 --> 00:35:30,024
for some phones with
two-factor authentication.

700
00:35:30,058 --> 00:35:31,267
- Can you unlock it?

701
00:35:31,301 --> 00:35:32,958
- This will
brute-force some codes

702
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,753
by overriding the lockout.

703
00:35:34,787 --> 00:35:35,961
It might take a minute.

704
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:39,896
[keyboard clacking]

705
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:42,381
Okay, let's see.

706
00:35:46,868 --> 00:35:48,456
Bingo.

707
00:35:48,491 --> 00:35:50,286
You're lucky, it was
a four-digit code.

708
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,701
3959.

709
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:55,498
- Thanks, Ted.

710
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,244
- [Bill] It's not that
we don't appreciate it.

711
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:19,901
Northlight just has a lot
of studies to look at.

712
00:36:19,936 --> 00:36:22,697
- Was there something
wrong with our work?

713
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:25,079
- No, no, your
work is excellent.

714
00:36:25,113 --> 00:36:27,633
And that's why they
authorized me to award you

715
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:31,913
a grant of $780,000
for continued funding

716
00:36:31,948 --> 00:36:33,156
of your other research.

717
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:38,265
- Wow.

718
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:42,303
This is very generous
of you, Bill.

719
00:36:42,338 --> 00:36:44,340
It would mean a lot to the lab.

720
00:36:44,374 --> 00:36:47,826
- If you'll just sign
these modification papers

721
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,449
we can process the grant
as part of the new set up.

722
00:36:50,484 --> 00:36:52,865
Should be able to get
your funds within a week.

723
00:36:57,145 --> 00:36:57,974
- All right.

724
00:36:58,906 --> 00:37:02,012
Um, let me look over these

725
00:37:02,047 --> 00:37:04,705
and I'll get back to you.

726
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:06,258
- It's pretty standard stuff.

727
00:37:06,293 --> 00:37:08,260
Just wanna get you up and
running quickly, you know?

728
00:37:08,295 --> 00:37:09,157
Get this thing moving.

729
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:10,366
- Yeah, yeah.

730
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,438
Um, I'll have them
read by the morning.

731
00:37:13,472 --> 00:37:14,646
Fair enough?

732
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,095
- Yeah, yeah.

733
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,752
You bet.

734
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:19,340
- Wow, this is amazing.

735
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,618
Thank you, Bill.
- Thank you.

736
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:22,895
- Good to see you, Bill.

737
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:24,621
- Tomorrow.
- Oh yeah, for sure.

738
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:43,433
- What's this guy's deal?

739
00:37:43,468 --> 00:37:44,296
- Never mind that.

740
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:45,263
He's a piece of shit.

741
00:37:46,954 --> 00:37:47,782
- All right.

742
00:37:50,509 --> 00:37:51,545
Looks like being an informant

743
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:56,377
doesn't pay what it used to.

744
00:37:56,412 --> 00:37:57,275
206?
- 206.

745
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:10,184
[guns cocking]

746
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:14,464
- Fuck.

747
00:38:23,922 --> 00:38:26,511
How much you wanna bet the
list was on the fucking laptop?

748
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:28,306
Let's get the hell out of here.

749
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:41,871
[Guy inhaling sharply]

750
00:38:41,905 --> 00:38:43,804
- Who took the list?

751
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:45,978
- How the fuck
would we know that?

752
00:38:46,013 --> 00:38:46,841
- Fuck!

753
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:49,844
Okay.

754
00:38:49,879 --> 00:38:50,776
What do we do now?

755
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,537
- Nothing.

756
00:38:52,571 --> 00:38:53,572
The deal goes down as planned.

757
00:38:53,607 --> 00:38:54,953
- Nah, no way.

758
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:56,437
It's too risky.

759
00:38:56,472 --> 00:38:58,094
- The Armenians can be trusted.

760
00:38:59,509 --> 00:39:00,786
- I don't know.

761
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:02,270
I think we should
just wait and see if-

762
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,479
- They want 3 million.

763
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:07,966
- Street value?
- No.

764
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,106
Raw fentanyl, at your price.

765
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:15,111
- Still, the timing feels wrong.

766
00:39:15,145 --> 00:39:16,906
- Look, I'll guarantee the cash.

767
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,390
Right to the switch point.

768
00:39:18,425 --> 00:39:20,288
And you have no
distribution exposure.

769
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:22,187
And even if there is a snitch,

770
00:39:22,221 --> 00:39:25,017
as long as it's kept
between Mother, you, and me,

771
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:27,399
no one will find out about it.

772
00:39:27,434 --> 00:39:28,987
- Fuck, I'll think it over.

773
00:39:29,021 --> 00:39:30,954
- You'd better hurry,
'cause we can buy elsewhere.

774
00:39:30,989 --> 00:39:31,886
- Ah, fuck.

775
00:39:31,921 --> 00:39:33,440
Just drive the fucking car.

776
00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:35,890
[slow music]

777
00:39:44,692 --> 00:39:47,868
- After you hired me, I
read the police report.

778
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:49,835
It said that your son died

779
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:54,771
from an overdose of
oxycodone 80-milligram pills,

780
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:56,670
ingested and inhaled.

781
00:39:56,704 --> 00:39:57,498
- Yeah, I know.

782
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:58,430
I read the report.

783
00:39:58,465 --> 00:39:59,845
- Well, here's the thing.

784
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,778
There's no smoke in his lungs.

785
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:04,609
- No smoke?

786
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:06,265
- And from the pink
condition of his lungs,

787
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,992
I'd say he didn't smoke ever.

788
00:40:09,027 --> 00:40:12,858
Further, there's severe bruising
on the back of his head.

789
00:40:19,865 --> 00:40:21,211
- [Claire] What are you saying?

790
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:23,041
- Either your son took 10

791
00:40:23,075 --> 00:40:25,526
80-milligram oxys
on his first try

792
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:27,252
this night on his way home-
- Or what?

793
00:40:27,286 --> 00:40:28,253
Someone hit him over the head

794
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:29,427
and forced him to swallow them?

795
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,289
Is that...

796
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:33,500
How could the cops miss that?

797
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:35,571
- Cops miss a lot of things.

798
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:37,365
I know, I used to be one.

799
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:41,197
- How did he die?

800
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:45,477
- As I said, the indication is-

801
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:48,411
- No, I mean, how?

802
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:51,207
What was it like for him?

803
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:55,487
- Do you really wanna know?

804
00:40:57,627 --> 00:40:59,042
- I need to know.

805
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:16,508
- And with that, I bid you,

806
00:41:16,543 --> 00:41:20,995
go forth and bring
me a breakthrough.

807
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,862
Bonne chance! [claps]
[students chattering]

808
00:41:25,897 --> 00:41:27,450
Hey, Geoff.

809
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,176
You have fun the other night?

810
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,039
- I did.

811
00:41:31,661 --> 00:41:36,045
- Now, honestly, did
I overcook the fish?

812
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,116
- Honestly, I thought
it was chicken.

813
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,325
[laughing]

814
00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:41,878
- What's up?

815
00:41:41,913 --> 00:41:44,363
- Well, I heard about this
situation with Northlight,

816
00:41:44,398 --> 00:41:45,675
the pharmaceutical study.

817
00:41:47,435 --> 00:41:49,852
One of the trustees know
somebody on their board.

818
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:52,337
- Yeah?

819
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:53,614
- Well, as you know,

820
00:41:53,649 --> 00:41:55,789
I'm not a big fan of
these arrangements.

821
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:58,446
- Well, we've never
had a problem before.

822
00:41:58,481 --> 00:42:00,138
- Well, no, but I have.

823
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,175
The situation is not
unique to you, Ty.

824
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,039
I got a lot of teachers
that pay their rent

825
00:42:05,074 --> 00:42:06,489
with these corporate studies,

826
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,043
which means I'm often
asked to look the other way

827
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:10,769
on the inherent conflicts.

828
00:42:10,804 --> 00:42:12,012
- Added to which,

829
00:42:12,046 --> 00:42:14,566
Northlight is one of the
school's major donors.

830
00:42:14,601 --> 00:42:17,293
- That's not fair
and you know it.

831
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:19,019
- I'm not trying to make
waves for you, Geoff.

832
00:42:19,053 --> 00:42:20,434
- Well, then, you
can see why we don't

833
00:42:20,468 --> 00:42:22,919
wanna make a federal
case out of this thing.

834
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,819
I understand they want
you to sign something.

835
00:42:25,853 --> 00:42:27,027
- [Tyrone] [chuckles]
Have you read it?

836
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:28,511
- I've read enough of it.

837
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,099
- Well, then you will
know that they want me

838
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:31,514
to sign a statement saying

839
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,206
we made significant errors,

840
00:42:34,241 --> 00:42:35,829
that we cannot be relied upon,

841
00:42:35,863 --> 00:42:39,246
which is as bizarre a
request as I have ever seen.

842
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,523
- Who cares if it's bizarre?

843
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,007
It's a confidential agreement.

844
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,388
- We have been a good source
for them for eight years,

845
00:42:43,422 --> 00:42:45,942
and the one time, the one time,

846
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:47,772
that my results
contradict theirs,

847
00:42:47,806 --> 00:42:50,188
all of a sudden they
want an expanded

848
00:42:50,222 --> 00:42:51,914
confidentiality agreement?

849
00:42:53,294 --> 00:42:57,402
Geoff, you know
what this is about.

850
00:42:57,436 --> 00:43:00,612
- No, we're not jumping to
any conclusions here, okay?

851
00:43:00,647 --> 00:43:02,545
Our job is to be educators,

852
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,859
not to grapple with big pharma.

853
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:09,690
Let's just think about
signing what it is they want

854
00:43:09,725 --> 00:43:11,934
and we can be done with this.

855
00:43:11,968 --> 00:43:15,075
[slow intense music]

856
00:43:24,049 --> 00:43:24,912
- [Simon Voicemail]
Hey, it's Simon.

857
00:43:24,947 --> 00:43:26,845
Please leave a message.

858
00:43:47,383 --> 00:43:50,179
[engine whirring]

859
00:43:50,213 --> 00:43:53,700
[upbeat electronic music]

860
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,962
- Hey.

861
00:44:48,996 --> 00:44:49,790
Hey.

862
00:44:49,825 --> 00:44:51,136
- Hey, what do you want?

863
00:44:51,171 --> 00:44:53,932
- I'm uh, I'm, I'm
David's mother.

864
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:55,934
David Reimann.
- Yeah, I know.

865
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:57,833
- Then why did you
walk away from me?

866
00:44:58,972 --> 00:45:00,387
- I don't know.

867
00:45:00,421 --> 00:45:02,044
- On his phone there was a
bunch of missed calls from you.

868
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:03,286
What did you want?

869
00:45:03,321 --> 00:45:04,909
- We were friends.
- No.

870
00:45:04,943 --> 00:45:06,186
You weren't my son's friend.

871
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:07,739
If you were, I would've
known your name.

872
00:45:07,774 --> 00:45:10,811
- Simon, are you okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

873
00:45:10,846 --> 00:45:12,433
- Why don't you leave him alone?

874
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:13,676
- Come with me.

875
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,643
- Look, we hung out
a couple of times,

876
00:45:15,678 --> 00:45:16,886
it wasn't a big deal.

877
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:18,232
So, then, what did
you want with him?

878
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:20,510
- I mean, I wasn't
his friend exactly.

879
00:45:20,545 --> 00:45:21,960
Um, Cedric was.

880
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,274
- Cedric Beauville?

881
00:45:25,308 --> 00:45:26,931
From the hockey camp?

882
00:45:26,965 --> 00:45:28,139
You went to Montrose?

883
00:45:28,173 --> 00:45:29,105
- Yeah.

884
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,728
Look, all I know is
that Cedric needed him

885
00:45:30,762 --> 00:45:32,108
and he told me to find him.

886
00:45:33,385 --> 00:45:34,214
- Wait.

887
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:36,216
Where can I find Cedric?

888
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,873
- You didn't hear?
- What?

889
00:45:37,907 --> 00:45:39,495
- It was on the news.
- What?

890
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:41,704
- Look, I really
don't know anything.

891
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:42,843
I only ran for them once.

892
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:44,258
It wasn't a big deal.

893
00:45:45,915 --> 00:45:46,778
- You ran drugs?

894
00:45:47,779 --> 00:45:48,573
Come with me.

895
00:45:49,608 --> 00:45:50,748
- All right, all right.

896
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:52,542
Look, look, it was
Derrick up in Montreal.

897
00:45:52,577 --> 00:45:53,785
He runs a lot of oxy there.

898
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,167
Just please don't tell
him I said anything.

899
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:09,283
[slow music]

900
00:46:10,388 --> 00:46:11,285
- [Stan On Phone]
Nobody's heard anything

901
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,597
from the Armenians on the wires.

902
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:14,392
If you don't get them
to buy from Mother soon,

903
00:46:14,426 --> 00:46:15,634
it's all gonna fall apart.

904
00:46:15,669 --> 00:46:17,809
I really think you
gotta get back here.

905
00:46:17,844 --> 00:46:19,742
- [Jake] Okay, I'm
on my way back.

906
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,813
- [Stan On Phone] Jake,
we're running out of time.

907
00:46:21,848 --> 00:46:22,952
- Yeah, I said I'm on my way.

908
00:46:22,987 --> 00:46:25,196
I'll be there when I'm there.

909
00:46:33,549 --> 00:46:36,207
[phone ringing]

910
00:46:39,348 --> 00:46:40,142
- Oui.

911
00:46:40,176 --> 00:46:41,143
- Just spoke to my guys.

912
00:46:41,177 --> 00:46:41,971
They're good to go.

913
00:46:42,006 --> 00:46:43,145
Are we on?

914
00:46:43,179 --> 00:46:44,077
- Yeah, we're on.

915
00:46:45,423 --> 00:46:46,976
But one thing.

916
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:48,046
You come alone.

917
00:46:49,392 --> 00:46:51,153
- What, and carry
everything out on my back?

918
00:46:51,187 --> 00:46:51,981
No.

919
00:46:52,016 --> 00:46:53,638
My guys bring in trucks.

920
00:46:53,672 --> 00:46:54,639
- [Guy] After you pay.

921
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:55,847
- No way.

922
00:46:55,882 --> 00:46:57,159
- All right, then forget it.

923
00:46:59,678 --> 00:47:01,853
- [Jake] Okay, I bring in
a million as a deposit,

924
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:03,751
but I wanna see the goods.

925
00:47:03,786 --> 00:47:06,478
After that, my guys come
in and they bring the rest.

926
00:47:06,513 --> 00:47:07,514
That's it.

927
00:47:07,548 --> 00:47:08,377
Yes or no?

928
00:47:09,585 --> 00:47:10,482
- [Guy] Yes.

929
00:47:10,517 --> 00:47:11,518
- Good.

930
00:47:11,552 --> 00:47:13,071
But I'm coming with big money,

931
00:47:13,106 --> 00:47:14,486
so I wanna see your
operation first.

932
00:47:14,521 --> 00:47:15,453
I need to know that
you can actually

933
00:47:15,487 --> 00:47:16,730
step up and handle this.

934
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:19,802
- [Guy] I'll talk to Mother.

935
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:25,428
- [Armen] Look, it's just bad.

936
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:27,327
Now the feds are
tracking prescriptions,

937
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:29,191
the smart move is walk away.

938
00:47:29,225 --> 00:47:31,089
- Yeah, that's why
we're walking away

939
00:47:31,124 --> 00:47:34,541
from the pill mill business
and getting into fentanyl.

940
00:47:34,575 --> 00:47:35,749
Mother's ready.

941
00:47:35,783 --> 00:47:36,784
- Too much heat.

942
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,583
For all we know, we're under
surveillance right now.

943
00:47:42,618 --> 00:47:43,895
- Look, if we pussy out now-

944
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,897
- Pussy out?

945
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:48,417
Not a very sophisticated
way to look at it.

946
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,730
Maybe we should listen
to Armen and walk.

947
00:47:54,181 --> 00:47:57,322
On the other hand,
the demand is high,

948
00:47:57,357 --> 00:48:00,049
and the junkies are
fiends for this.

949
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:01,982
Maybe it's worth the risk.

950
00:48:02,017 --> 00:48:03,673
- If we go a million a piece

951
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:05,986
we can turn 3 million into 30.

952
00:48:07,815 --> 00:48:09,576
- I don't have a million.

953
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,785
- Fuckin' Maserati
Minas over there does.

954
00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:12,613
He's rich.

955
00:48:12,648 --> 00:48:14,132
Borrow some from him.

956
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:15,962
- What a brave
fellow you are, Jake.

957
00:48:20,207 --> 00:48:21,588
We'll let you know tomorrow.

958
00:48:29,216 --> 00:48:31,909
- RCMP say they've
arrested Cedric Beauville.

959
00:48:31,943 --> 00:48:34,187
The 18-year-old was
crossing this snowy,

960
00:48:34,221 --> 00:48:38,053
unpatrolled stretch of the
border wearing camouflage.

961
00:48:38,087 --> 00:48:39,778
Authorities say he
set off the alarm

962
00:48:39,813 --> 00:48:41,539
at the Saint-Armand crossing

963
00:48:41,573 --> 00:48:44,611
where he was caught with
over half a million dollars

964
00:48:44,645 --> 00:48:45,992
of fentanyl pills.

965
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:48,166
The pills are a
public health menace

966
00:48:48,201 --> 00:48:51,273
and are popular among
younger drug users.

967
00:48:51,307 --> 00:48:52,757
Beauville is being held

968
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:55,449
at the federal detention
center in Montreal, Quebec. -

969
00:48:56,864 --> 00:48:58,901
So, you weren't contracted
to work with Klaralon.

970
00:48:58,936 --> 00:48:59,729
How'd you get it?

971
00:49:00,903 --> 00:49:01,800
- I don't follow.

972
00:49:01,835 --> 00:49:03,250
- The drug Klaralon.

973
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:04,251
It's not on market yet.

974
00:49:04,286 --> 00:49:05,183
How'd you get it?

975
00:49:05,218 --> 00:49:06,564
- From the chemistry department.

976
00:49:06,598 --> 00:49:08,359
I asked them to make me some.

977
00:49:08,393 --> 00:49:09,739
- Based on the
patent literature,

978
00:49:09,774 --> 00:49:13,398
you had our chemistry department
synthesize it for you?

979
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:14,986
- Yeah, we do it
all the time, Geoff.

980
00:49:15,021 --> 00:49:15,987
You know that.

981
00:49:16,022 --> 00:49:17,471
- And now based on your results,

982
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:19,887
you want Northlight to pull
their billion dollar drug,

983
00:49:19,922 --> 00:49:22,097
a drug that's just
about to hit the market,

984
00:49:22,131 --> 00:49:24,651
off the market for
some further testing.

985
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:27,309
- The results show
co-valent bonds-

986
00:49:27,343 --> 00:49:28,966
- Chris, can you talk to
him about the liability?

987
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,450
- Yeah.

988
00:49:30,484 --> 00:49:32,314
The original agreement that
you signed eight years ago

989
00:49:32,348 --> 00:49:35,282
already contained a
confidentiality provision.

990
00:49:35,317 --> 00:49:37,043
You still can't share
your findings with anyone.

991
00:49:37,077 --> 00:49:38,009
- Well, that's insane.

992
00:49:38,044 --> 00:49:39,873
This is a public health issue.

993
00:49:39,907 --> 00:49:42,393
- Dammit, Tyrone, we
don't know that at all!

994
00:49:42,427 --> 00:49:43,670
And just so you know,

995
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:45,154
Northlight spoke to a
number of your clients

996
00:49:45,189 --> 00:49:47,018
and they also had strange
results from your labs.

997
00:49:47,053 --> 00:49:48,295
- What clients?
- And when pressed further,

998
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,056
many of them had
significant questions

999
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,747
about your testing methodology.

1000
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:53,266
- If people are accusing
me of being unprofessional,

1001
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:55,130
I think I have a right to know.

1002
00:49:55,164 --> 00:49:57,477
- If you leak Northlight's data,

1003
00:49:57,511 --> 00:49:59,789
the university can be liable.

1004
00:49:59,824 --> 00:50:01,688
- And we're talking
about Northlight,

1005
00:50:01,722 --> 00:50:02,689
a multibillion-dollar
manufacturer

1006
00:50:02,723 --> 00:50:04,932
from three generations

1007
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:07,073
of one of the richest
families on the planet,

1008
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:08,591
a family that, I think
we can all agree,

1009
00:50:08,626 --> 00:50:09,765
has done a lot of
good in the world.

1010
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,284
- Oh, have they?

1011
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:14,528
If we knew about oxycodone
then and could've spoken,

1012
00:50:14,563 --> 00:50:15,943
look at all the harm
we could've prevented,

1013
00:50:15,978 --> 00:50:16,944
the lives we could've saved.

1014
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:18,325
- If you take it upon yourself

1015
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:21,121
to publish Northlight's
proprietary data-

1016
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:24,055
- Dr. Brower, you
could even be liable

1017
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:25,298
for criminal charges.

1018
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:30,372
- [laughs] A crime?

1019
00:50:30,406 --> 00:50:32,650
For telling the truth?

1020
00:50:32,684 --> 00:50:34,893
I don't believe it.
- Believe it!

1021
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:39,277
Tyrone, you know I respect you,

1022
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:40,554
but I need you to promise

1023
00:50:40,589 --> 00:50:43,040
that you won't share
this data with anyone.

1024
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,284
Tenure's not forever, you know?

1025
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:49,046
Neither is your reputation.

1026
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:51,945
- What is that supposed to mean?

1027
00:50:51,979 --> 00:50:54,741
- You bring shame
upon this university

1028
00:50:54,775 --> 00:50:56,915
and it can cost you
a hell of a lot more

1029
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:01,127
than your teaching job.
[slow suspenseful music]

1030
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,488
[phone ringing]

1031
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:53,696
- [Policeman] You have reached

1032
00:51:53,731 --> 00:51:55,388
the Gratiot Police
Department after hours.

1033
00:51:55,422 --> 00:51:58,770
If you have the extension of
the party you'd like to reach-

1034
00:52:25,797 --> 00:52:27,385
- This is always the way.

1035
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,630
First it was tobacco,
then it was oxy.

1036
00:52:30,664 --> 00:52:32,356
Now it's your turn.

1037
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:34,081
Dangerous territory.

1038
00:52:34,116 --> 00:52:36,118
- If this carries over
to the human trials,

1039
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,810
not only is this painkiller
not non-addictive,

1040
00:52:38,845 --> 00:52:43,056
it's three times more
addictive than oxy.

1041
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:46,266
- They're in the final stages
of their FDA submission.

1042
00:52:46,301 --> 00:52:47,854
If your report became public,

1043
00:52:47,888 --> 00:52:50,408
they'd have to withdraw
their request for approval,

1044
00:52:50,443 --> 00:52:51,961
all for some mice

1045
00:52:51,996 --> 00:52:53,963
that are outside the scope
of the agreed protocol?

1046
00:52:55,241 --> 00:52:56,380
- And nobody cares.

1047
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,007
I could always
take it somewhere.

1048
00:53:04,353 --> 00:53:06,183
- [Dr. Ishiyama] Where?

1049
00:53:06,217 --> 00:53:07,667
- [Tyrone] How about the FDA?

1050
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,773
- [Dr. Ishiyama] Tyrone,
this is not something

1051
00:53:10,808 --> 00:53:12,706
you wanna bring upon
yourself lightly.

1052
00:53:13,673 --> 00:53:14,950
You've gotta have a plan.

1053
00:53:15,916 --> 00:53:17,159
- A plan?

1054
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,609
For telling the truth?

1055
00:53:18,643 --> 00:53:19,817
- Don't be naive.

1056
00:53:20,714 --> 00:53:22,199
Sometimes that's not enough.

1057
00:53:24,097 --> 00:53:26,203
And we've both done a
lot of contract work

1058
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:29,309
is this really the
worst you've ever seen?

1059
00:53:31,484 --> 00:53:32,312
- The worst.

1060
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,246
- Then be careful.

1061
00:54:11,006 --> 00:54:12,525
- Yeah, to a T.

1062
00:54:13,974 --> 00:54:14,803
Yes, sir.

1063
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:16,460
Thank you.

1064
00:54:17,875 --> 00:54:19,221
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1065
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,429
- But you'll approve it?

1066
00:54:20,464 --> 00:54:22,983
- If you guys get the
Armenians on board,

1067
00:54:23,018 --> 00:54:25,503
I can authorize a
mil in flash money.

1068
00:54:25,538 --> 00:54:26,953
- [Jake] Yes.

1069
00:54:26,987 --> 00:54:28,644
- But the whole op is gonna
have to be supervised.

1070
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:30,715
- We won't have advance
notice to get cameras in.

1071
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:32,717
- You can use surveillance
vans, can't you?

1072
00:54:32,752 --> 00:54:33,546
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

1073
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,409
- [Jake] Yes.

1074
00:54:34,443 --> 00:54:35,962
- All right.

1075
00:54:35,996 --> 00:54:37,515
Stan, you're willing to go
out in the field with him?

1076
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,378
- Yes.

1077
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:41,312
- Okay, sign right there.

1078
00:54:41,347 --> 00:54:44,660
Anything happens to that
money, it's your asses.

1079
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:45,558
[phone vibrating]

1080
00:54:45,592 --> 00:54:46,766
- Nothing's gonna
happen to the money.

1081
00:54:48,215 --> 00:54:50,045
- Excuse me one second.
- I guaran-fucking-tee it.

1082
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,011
- Hello?

1083
00:54:51,046 --> 00:54:52,116
- [Woman On Phone]
Hi, is this Mr. Kelly?

1084
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,324
- Yeah, this is him.

1085
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,498
- [Woman On Phone]
Yes, I'm calling

1086
00:54:54,532 --> 00:54:55,775
from Gables Treatment
to let you know

1087
00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:57,052
that your sister has
checked herself out.

1088
00:54:57,086 --> 00:54:58,295
- What?

1089
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:02,644
[intense music]
[tires screeching]

1090
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:05,025
Mom, how much did she get?

1091
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:06,268
- [Anne] Well, it looks
like all of it, Jake.

1092
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,683
Are you gonna go
to the pawn shops?

1093
00:55:07,718 --> 00:55:09,892
- Pawn shops were
open hours ago.

1094
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:11,100
I'm passing the buy spots now.

1095
00:55:11,135 --> 00:55:12,585
I'll call you when I get her.

1096
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:24,735
- Hey, Jake, man.

1097
00:55:25,632 --> 00:55:27,116
What up, dog?

1098
00:55:27,151 --> 00:55:30,534
Yo, yo, you all right?
[groaning]

1099
00:55:32,674 --> 00:55:34,331
- Where is she?
[Frankie groans]

1100
00:55:46,412 --> 00:55:47,896
Is that it?
- Yeah.

1101
00:55:52,659 --> 00:55:54,489
- How many people are
in there with her?

1102
00:55:54,523 --> 00:55:56,698
- I don't know, man,
I don't go in there.

1103
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:57,630
Come on.

1104
00:55:57,664 --> 00:55:59,148
- Get the fuck out of here.

1105
00:56:26,003 --> 00:56:31,008
[banging]
[mellow electronic music]

1106
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:00,382
Fuck.

1107
00:57:03,489 --> 00:57:04,628
- Get your hands off me.
- It's okay.

1108
00:57:04,662 --> 00:57:05,663
It's okay, come on.

1109
00:57:05,698 --> 00:57:06,906
Come on.
- Hey.

1110
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,976
- Come on, Emmie.
- Hey.

1111
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,356
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

1112
00:57:09,391 --> 00:57:10,979
- Get your hands off me.

1113
00:57:11,013 --> 00:57:12,601
- Hey.

1114
00:57:12,636 --> 00:57:13,913
- Sit the fuck down.

1115
00:57:16,743 --> 00:57:20,402
It's okay.
- Hey, get your hands off me.

1116
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,784
Get your fucking
hands off me, Jake!

1117
00:57:22,818 --> 00:57:24,682
- It's okay.
- No!

1118
00:57:24,717 --> 00:57:25,614
No!
- It's okay.

1119
00:57:25,649 --> 00:57:27,444
- Get your fucking hands off me!

1120
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:30,964
Get your hands off me
now, you're fucking...

1121
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:36,832
Help!
[slow intense music]

1122
00:58:32,198 --> 00:58:34,614
[indistinct]

1123
00:58:58,258 --> 00:58:59,536
- Dr. Brower.

1124
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,572
I'm Ben Walker, from the FDA.

1125
00:59:01,607 --> 00:59:02,435
May I sit?

1126
00:59:04,299 --> 00:59:06,439
- Do you have some ID?
- Yes.

1127
00:59:09,649 --> 00:59:10,892
I'm glad you reached out.

1128
00:59:12,445 --> 00:59:14,723
Well, I read your report.

1129
00:59:15,724 --> 00:59:17,036
Who else knows about this?

1130
00:59:18,278 --> 00:59:20,418
- Northlight, obviously.

1131
00:59:20,453 --> 00:59:22,248
The university.

1132
00:59:22,282 --> 00:59:24,388
They're not happy with me.

1133
00:59:24,422 --> 00:59:26,390
- There's some things I
need to ask you about.

1134
00:59:26,424 --> 00:59:27,909
- [Tyrone] Go ahead.

1135
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:29,117
- I understand
there was an issue

1136
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,428
of sexual harassment
some years back?

1137
00:59:30,463 --> 00:59:31,637
With a student?
- Oh, Jesus.

1138
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:33,224
You really have been
checking up on me.

1139
00:59:34,743 --> 00:59:37,746
[sighs] I was cleared.

1140
00:59:37,781 --> 00:59:38,609
- [Ben] But what was it?

1141
00:59:38,644 --> 00:59:40,059
- It was nothing.

1142
00:59:40,093 --> 00:59:41,888
[stammers] A remark I
made one night in the lab

1143
00:59:41,923 --> 00:59:43,476
and it got blown
out of proportion.

1144
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:45,098
- The tenure committee
didn't think so.

1145
00:59:45,133 --> 00:59:46,893
You were censured.
- I was cleared!

1146
00:59:48,861 --> 00:59:50,483
- You've gotta prepare yourself.

1147
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:54,763
- Will the FDA take action?

1148
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:56,282
- I'm not gonna lie to you.

1149
00:59:56,316 --> 00:59:59,250
Science at this level is often
a matter of interpretation.

1150
00:59:59,285 --> 01:00:02,875
- This is not
interpretation, this is data.

1151
01:00:02,909 --> 01:00:04,048
- What I'm saying is,

1152
01:00:04,083 --> 01:00:05,878
until now you've mainly
been a validator,

1153
01:00:05,912 --> 01:00:08,639
taking the money and letting
the studies play themselves.

1154
01:00:08,674 --> 01:00:10,814
- Well, that's pretty cynical.

1155
01:00:10,848 --> 01:00:13,023
I like to think I did a
little more than that.

1156
01:00:13,057 --> 01:00:14,369
- Through your own
research, maybe,

1157
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:15,612
but as far as your
outside contracts-

1158
01:00:15,646 --> 01:00:16,785
- Who the hell are you?

1159
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:19,788
Some bureaucrat with
a plastic badge.

1160
01:00:19,823 --> 01:00:23,067
You're here because
I pressed the button,

1161
01:00:23,102 --> 01:00:25,829
and you wanna ridicule me.

1162
01:00:25,863 --> 01:00:27,244
- They're gonna come after you.

1163
01:00:27,278 --> 01:00:28,728
They'll say you're a drunk.

1164
01:00:28,763 --> 01:00:29,902
- I'm not a drunk.

1165
01:00:29,936 --> 01:00:32,180
- And a bad scientist,
undistinguished,

1166
01:00:32,214 --> 01:00:33,560
whatever they can think of.

1167
01:00:33,595 --> 01:00:35,010
But what you're doing now

1168
01:00:35,045 --> 01:00:37,254
may be the most important
thing you ever do.

1169
01:00:41,258 --> 01:00:44,054
[camera clicking]

1170
01:00:50,716 --> 01:00:52,303
- Come on, out.
- Get off me.

1171
01:00:52,338 --> 01:00:53,891
Don't fucking touch me.

1172
01:00:53,926 --> 01:00:55,513
Oh, you're taking
me back to Mom now?

1173
01:00:55,548 --> 01:00:56,687
You're gonna fucking tell on me?

1174
01:00:56,722 --> 01:00:58,206
Is that it?

1175
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,656
- Do you have any idea
what you're doing to Mom?

1176
01:01:00,587 --> 01:01:01,485
[indistinct]

1177
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:02,348
- Mommy.

1178
01:01:03,418 --> 01:01:04,764
Look what he did to me.
- In the house.

1179
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:05,696
- Jake, handcuffs?
- Jake, these really hurt,

1180
01:01:05,731 --> 01:01:06,870
I'm telling you.

1181
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:08,009
Take them off.
- Mom, don't start.

1182
01:01:08,043 --> 01:01:09,182
- It's our house.
- Listen.

1183
01:01:10,908 --> 01:01:11,944
You gonna relax?
- Yes.

1184
01:01:11,978 --> 01:01:13,428
- Can you behave?
- Yes.

1185
01:01:14,912 --> 01:01:16,742
- Take it off, please.

1186
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:23,162
Thank you.

1187
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:25,923
[spits]
[groaning]

1188
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:27,166
Fuck you!

1189
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,823
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Fuck you!

1190
01:01:28,857 --> 01:01:29,686
- God.

1191
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,997
What is wrong with you?

1192
01:01:31,032 --> 01:01:32,240
- It's my fucking life!
- Give me your hands.

1193
01:01:32,274 --> 01:01:34,000
- You can't help me.

1194
01:01:34,035 --> 01:01:36,313
You think you can fucking
help me like this?

1195
01:01:36,347 --> 01:01:38,522
Ow, you're hurting me! - What
the fuck is wrong with you?

1196
01:01:38,556 --> 01:01:39,730
- Fuck you!
- Why are you like this?

1197
01:01:39,765 --> 01:01:41,076
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1198
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:42,043
- You're a fucking disgrace!
- Look what you

1199
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:43,078
just did to me.

1200
01:01:43,113 --> 01:01:44,942
You're a fucking disgrace.

1201
01:01:44,977 --> 01:01:45,771
Mom!

1202
01:01:48,428 --> 01:01:50,568
I fucking hate you both!
- Mom.

1203
01:01:50,603 --> 01:01:51,431
Mom.
- You hear me?

1204
01:01:51,466 --> 01:01:52,778
Mom.
- I hate you!

1205
01:01:52,812 --> 01:01:55,539
- You leave her there
for two days, okay?

1206
01:01:56,643 --> 01:01:58,197
Be strong.
- Okay.

1207
01:01:58,231 --> 01:02:00,544
[slow music]

1208
01:02:03,823 --> 01:02:04,651
I love you.

1209
01:02:06,067 --> 01:02:06,964
- Love you.

1210
01:02:13,419 --> 01:02:15,559
- [Harold] You said
it was non-addictive.

1211
01:02:15,593 --> 01:02:17,009
- It is.

1212
01:02:17,043 --> 01:02:19,597
Brower's study is outside
the prescribing scope.

1213
01:02:19,632 --> 01:02:21,599
It's not apples to apples.

1214
01:02:21,634 --> 01:02:22,946
- So, what, you're
saying that if they take

1215
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,293
it within the 30-day
window prescribed

1216
01:02:25,327 --> 01:02:26,915
they won't get addicted?

1217
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,158
- Yeah, that's right.

1218
01:02:28,192 --> 01:02:29,815
- And if they take
it longer than that?

1219
01:02:29,849 --> 01:02:32,369
- Some patients might
develop dependence,

1220
01:02:32,403 --> 01:02:33,646
but that's only if they abuse it

1221
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,923
by taking it too long.

1222
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,306
- [Harold] Well,
do you have a plan?

1223
01:02:38,340 --> 01:02:39,790
- Discredit Brower.

1224
01:02:39,825 --> 01:02:42,344
We have already found
things from his past.

1225
01:02:42,379 --> 01:02:44,174
- What things?
- Indiscretions.

1226
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:45,347
They're in the dossier.

1227
01:02:46,521 --> 01:02:48,695
And remember, we have
successful human trials.

1228
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:51,250
He's just holding
up one animal study.

1229
01:02:51,284 --> 01:02:52,354
He'll quiet down.

1230
01:02:56,324 --> 01:02:58,464
- I think it's time
we got more involved.

1231
01:02:59,741 --> 01:03:02,157
[slow music]

1232
01:03:10,545 --> 01:03:13,375
[engine whirring]

01:04:43,949 --> 01:04:46,227

- This is the mixer.

1411
01:13:54,982 --> 01:13:57,225
It blends the powder
base with the fentanyl.

1412
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,091
This one takes the
fentanyl powder

1413
01:14:01,126 --> 01:14:02,610
and presses it into pills.

1414
01:14:03,749 --> 01:14:05,164
This is the counter machine.

1415
01:14:07,373 --> 01:14:09,445
Pills go in, pills go out

1416
01:14:10,618 --> 01:14:12,862
and drop directly into
your vitamin bottle.

1417
01:14:12,896 --> 01:14:15,589
Street value is $30 per pill.

1418
01:14:15,623 --> 01:14:16,659
- That's impressive.

1419
01:14:19,213 --> 01:14:22,043
[Mother coughing]

1420
01:14:23,528 --> 01:14:24,908
- What's your situation now?

1421
01:14:26,082 --> 01:14:27,739
- My guys will be
here in three days.

1422
01:14:27,773 --> 01:14:28,602
- Good.

1423
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,466
So, now you've seen.

1424
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:32,985
We're gonna be ready.

1425
01:14:34,849 --> 01:14:37,611
Oh, and also, uh,

1426
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:40,165
we took care of
that other problem.

1427
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:41,615
- What problem?

1428
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:43,099
- Cedric.

1429
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:44,031
The courier.

1430
01:14:44,963 --> 01:14:47,068
- Yeah?
- Yep.

1431
01:14:47,103 --> 01:14:48,380
- That son of a bitch is gone.

1432
01:14:48,414 --> 01:14:49,864
- Yeah. [laughs]

1433
01:14:49,899 --> 01:14:54,490
We also found out who the
informant was after all.

1434
01:14:55,732 --> 01:14:56,733
- [Guy] Oh, you did?

1435
01:14:58,701 --> 01:15:00,496
- [Mother] Oui.

1436
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:01,358
- Good, good.

1437
01:15:02,532 --> 01:15:03,499
And who was it?

1438
01:15:06,053 --> 01:15:09,677
- Well, [chuckles]
you knew all along,

1439
01:15:09,712 --> 01:15:11,299
it was you, Tabernac!

1440
01:15:11,334 --> 01:15:13,129
[gunshot]

1441
01:15:13,163 --> 01:15:13,957
[gun cocking]

1442
01:15:13,992 --> 01:15:17,064
[shouting in French]

1443
01:15:18,928 --> 01:15:22,518
He killed Davison in the hotel
room before you got there.

1444
01:15:22,552 --> 01:15:25,382
He stole the laptop because
he knew his name was on it.

1445
01:15:27,212 --> 01:15:28,938
He was an RCMP snitch.

1446
01:15:30,111 --> 01:15:30,940
- How, how-

1447
01:15:30,974 --> 01:15:32,182
[speaks in French]

1448
01:15:32,217 --> 01:15:33,045
Here.

1449
01:15:34,115 --> 01:15:35,013
We went to his house.

1450
01:15:35,047 --> 01:15:36,462
We find the laptop there.

1451
01:15:37,325 --> 01:15:38,879
But your name wasn't on it.

1452
01:15:40,674 --> 01:15:42,572
That was good news
for you, my friend.

1453
01:15:44,125 --> 01:15:46,058
But now you know the stakes.

1454
01:15:47,473 --> 01:15:51,167
Anything happens, we can touch
you anywhere in the world,

1455
01:15:51,201 --> 01:15:52,513
no matter who you are.

1456
01:15:54,619 --> 01:15:57,173
So, are we still on?

1457
01:15:59,106 --> 01:16:01,764
- Yeah.
[intense music]

1458
01:16:14,984 --> 01:16:17,158
[banging]

1459
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:48,983
[doorknob jiggling]

1460
01:16:49,950 --> 01:16:52,884
[glass shattering]

1461
01:16:53,885 --> 01:16:56,577
[lock clicking]

1462
01:17:35,927 --> 01:17:38,515
[door opening]

1463
01:17:40,172 --> 01:17:42,830
[Claire groans]

1464
01:17:44,107 --> 01:17:44,936
- Fuck.

1465
01:17:47,524 --> 01:17:48,767
- [Claire] Sit down, now!

1466
01:17:51,805 --> 01:17:52,702
- Please don't shoot me.

1467
01:17:52,737 --> 01:17:54,117
- Did you have my son killed?

1468
01:17:54,152 --> 01:17:57,293
- Please don't shoot.
- Did you have my son killed?

1469
01:17:57,327 --> 01:17:58,984
- Who?
- David.

1470
01:17:59,019 --> 01:18:00,814
David Reimann.

1471
01:18:05,163 --> 01:18:07,510
- I told them he
didn't know anything.

1472
01:18:07,544 --> 01:18:09,339
He just came along on one run.

1473
01:18:09,374 --> 01:18:11,445
- You had my son
run drugs for you?

1474
01:18:11,479 --> 01:18:12,308
- No.

1475
01:18:13,827 --> 01:18:16,381
It wasn't like that.
- Then what was it like?

1476
01:18:16,415 --> 01:18:17,727
Huh?

1477
01:18:17,762 --> 01:18:19,211
- We met at camp.

1478
01:18:19,246 --> 01:18:21,213
I asked him to come along
on a trip with some friends.

1479
01:18:21,248 --> 01:18:23,388
I hid the pills in David's bag.

1480
01:18:23,422 --> 01:18:25,424
He never even knew
what he was carrying.

1481
01:18:35,607 --> 01:18:38,437
- So, then, why
did they kill him?

1482
01:18:39,438 --> 01:18:40,785
Why not you?

1483
01:18:40,819 --> 01:18:41,993
- I don't know!

1484
01:18:42,027 --> 01:18:43,339
I didn't know they were
gonna kill anybody.

1485
01:18:43,373 --> 01:18:45,651
- You didn't know who
was gonna kill anybody?

1486
01:18:47,377 --> 01:18:48,206
- Mother.

1487
01:18:49,138 --> 01:18:50,691
Word is after Cedric got busted,

1488
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:52,003
he got completely paranoid

1489
01:18:52,037 --> 01:18:53,418
and started cutting loose ends.

1490
01:18:53,452 --> 01:18:54,833
I'm probably next.

1491
01:18:58,526 --> 01:19:00,805
Please don't shoot me.

1492
01:19:00,839 --> 01:19:01,702
Please.

1493
01:19:03,428 --> 01:19:04,256
Please.

1494
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:19,927
[water running]

1495
01:19:19,962 --> 01:19:22,067
[grunts]

1496
01:19:31,214 --> 01:19:34,045
[phone vibrating]

1497
01:19:36,841 --> 01:19:39,050
- Is it true?
- Is what true?

1498
01:19:39,084 --> 01:19:40,845
- Did they kill the kid?

1499
01:19:40,879 --> 01:19:42,225
Cedric.

1500
01:19:42,260 --> 01:19:43,433
- I'm afraid so.

1501
01:19:43,468 --> 01:19:44,710
They found him
foaming at the mouth

1502
01:19:44,745 --> 01:19:45,642
at the foot of his cell.

1503
01:19:45,677 --> 01:19:46,816
Somebody got to his food.

1504
01:19:48,197 --> 01:19:50,233
There's another
kid dead here, too.

1505
01:19:50,268 --> 01:19:51,856
- What kid?

1506
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:53,478
- Simon Gilcrest.

1507
01:19:53,512 --> 01:19:55,721
OD'd on oxy like
the Reimann boy.

1508
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:56,757
We don't know how
they're linked yet.

1509
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:58,517
He was probably another courier.

1510
01:19:58,552 --> 01:20:01,003
We think they all
went to the same camp.

1511
01:20:01,037 --> 01:20:01,900
- [Jake] Guy's dead, too.

1512
01:20:01,935 --> 01:20:02,832
- [Stan On Phone] What?

1513
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:03,902
How?
- Mother.

1514
01:20:04,869 --> 01:20:06,008
Just now.

1515
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:08,493
I was fucking standing
right next to him.

1516
01:20:08,527 --> 01:20:10,667
- [Stan On Phone] I think
we reconsider the meet.

1517
01:20:11,841 --> 01:20:12,738
- No.

1518
01:20:12,773 --> 01:20:13,878
- Jake, remember what happened

1519
01:20:13,912 --> 01:20:15,396
when Benny Alvarez
messed with these guys?

1520
01:20:15,431 --> 01:20:16,777
They're still pulling pieces
of his body out of the river.

1521
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,399
- Do you think I don't
fucking know that?

1522
01:20:18,434 --> 01:20:19,849
Huh?

1523
01:20:19,884 --> 01:20:21,023
Do you have any idea
what I just went through?

1524
01:20:21,057 --> 01:20:22,334
- They're doing
multiple homicides.

1525
01:20:22,369 --> 01:20:24,440
You cannot walk
into that buy alone.

1526
01:20:24,474 --> 01:20:26,235
- Mother said that-
- Fuck Mother!

1527
01:20:26,269 --> 01:20:27,546
Is he worth your life?

1528
01:20:32,931 --> 01:20:33,829
- We can't quit.

1529
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:37,453
We can't stop.

1530
01:20:39,765 --> 01:20:41,008
- At least let me have

1531
01:20:41,043 --> 01:20:42,596
some advance warning
to cover you, okay?

1532
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:43,597
Even 40 minutes.

1533
01:20:45,702 --> 01:20:46,496
- Okay, yeah.

1534
01:20:47,981 --> 01:20:49,499
I'll text you the meet
location as soon as I get it,

1535
01:20:49,534 --> 01:20:51,191
and you coordinate with RCMP.

1536
01:20:51,225 --> 01:20:53,400
But they can't fuck this up.

1537
01:20:53,434 --> 01:20:55,160
- [Stan On Phone] I'm on it.

1538
01:20:55,195 --> 01:20:57,645
- Okay, and be flexible.

1539
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,544
The meet location could
change at any minute.

1540
01:21:03,341 --> 01:21:05,308
- [Madira] I went
by the school today.

1541
01:21:05,343 --> 01:21:07,345
Why didn't you tell
me what was happening?

1542
01:21:09,209 --> 01:21:12,488
[Tyrone sighs heavily]

1543
01:21:16,733 --> 01:21:17,873
- I'm sorry, I...

1544
01:21:19,184 --> 01:21:21,152
I tried to take care of it, and,

1545
01:21:23,257 --> 01:21:24,569
it got so much bigger.

1546
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,920
I guess I overestimated myself.

1547
01:21:32,094 --> 01:21:33,854
- But why didn't you
share it with me?

1548
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:35,925
Do you think I
couldn't handle it?

1549
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:36,926
- No, no.

1550
01:21:36,961 --> 01:21:39,204
[stammers]

1551
01:21:40,481 --> 01:21:42,207
I didn't wanna worry you.

1552
01:21:42,242 --> 01:21:43,760
I wanted to protect you.

1553
01:21:43,795 --> 01:21:44,900
- Oh, come on.

1554
01:21:46,453 --> 01:21:47,799
We're in this together.

1555
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:51,182
And you have a responsibility.

1556
01:21:51,216 --> 01:21:53,287
- Yeah, to our family.

1557
01:21:53,322 --> 01:21:55,324
- To something larger than that.

1558
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:02,745
- If they let me go now,
under these circumstances,

1559
01:22:02,779 --> 01:22:05,748
I just can't turn around
and find another job.

1560
01:22:08,854 --> 01:22:10,408
I really don't know what to do.

1561
01:22:11,685 --> 01:22:13,514
- We will manage.

1562
01:22:13,549 --> 01:22:14,515
We will.

1563
01:22:16,172 --> 01:22:17,104
We always do.

1564
01:22:18,450 --> 01:22:19,279
- Yeah?

1565
01:22:28,184 --> 01:22:29,013
I'm sorry.

1566
01:22:43,682 --> 01:22:44,511
Um, Bill.

1567
01:22:45,512 --> 01:22:48,170
It's, uh, Tyrone.

1568
01:22:50,068 --> 01:22:52,312
I've thought about
your proposal.

1569
01:22:52,346 --> 01:22:53,899
Um.

1570
01:22:53,934 --> 01:22:55,867
Uh, let's come to
an arrangement.

1571
01:23:02,322 --> 01:23:04,980
[paper ripping]

1572
01:23:17,233 --> 01:23:19,925
[phone ringing]

1573
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,969
[Claire sighs]

1574
01:23:30,419 --> 01:23:31,868
- Hello?

1575
01:23:31,903 --> 01:23:34,423
- [Susan On Phone] Claire,
I've been trying to call you.

1576
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:36,080
Your car's not in the driveway.

1577
01:23:36,114 --> 01:23:36,977
Where are you?

1578
01:23:38,082 --> 01:23:38,944
- I'm traveling.

1579
01:23:38,979 --> 01:23:39,773
- Traveling?

1580
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:40,705
Where?

1581
01:23:40,739 --> 01:23:41,913
- [Claire On Phone] Listen, Sue,

1582
01:23:41,947 --> 01:23:43,777
I can't really talk
right now, okay?

1583
01:23:43,811 --> 01:23:45,503
I-
- What are you doing, Claire?

1584
01:23:47,988 --> 01:23:49,783
- Sue.
- Claire.

1585
01:23:50,784 --> 01:23:53,131
I know that this is hell.

1586
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:54,063
- You know,

1587
01:23:55,754 --> 01:23:57,135
the doctor said it took

1588
01:23:59,724 --> 01:24:02,451
four minutes for his
heart to give out.

1589
01:24:05,419 --> 01:24:07,559
It took him four minutes
to stop breathing.

1590
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:13,151
Four minutes his heart was
constricting in his chest,

1591
01:24:13,186 --> 01:24:15,947
like someone was strangling
him until he died.

1592
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:22,229
[sobbing]
- Claire.

1593
01:24:22,264 --> 01:24:23,575
- [Claire On Phone] I'm sorry.

1594
01:24:23,610 --> 01:24:24,473
- Claire.

1595
01:24:24,507 --> 01:24:25,336
Claire.

1596
01:24:26,164 --> 01:24:28,787
[Claire gasps]

1597
01:24:50,154 --> 01:24:52,846
[water running]

1598
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:07,412
- Dr. Brower.
- Yes.

1599
01:25:07,447 --> 01:25:08,620
- How are you?

1600
01:25:08,655 --> 01:25:09,759
I'm Sarah, Dr.
Simons' assistant.

1601
01:25:09,794 --> 01:25:10,726
- Hi.
- Follow me, please.

1602
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:12,072
- Thank you.

1603
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,591
- Did you find everything okay?

1604
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:14,488
- Yeah, thanks.

1605
01:25:17,871 --> 01:25:20,218
It's uh, quite a place, huh?

1606
01:25:20,253 --> 01:25:21,150
- [Sarah] Yeah.

1607
01:25:21,185 --> 01:25:22,600
I'm lucky to call it my office.

1608
01:25:34,059 --> 01:25:34,888
- [Bill] Tyrone.

1609
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:36,683
- [Tyrone] Bill.

1610
01:25:38,202 --> 01:25:39,893
- These are the
execution copies.

1611
01:25:41,066 --> 01:25:44,208
And here is the grant
check for your lab.

1612
01:25:47,901 --> 01:25:49,144
- It's made out to me.

1613
01:25:50,593 --> 01:25:51,974
- I'm sure you can
endorse it over,

1614
01:25:52,008 --> 01:25:53,734
if that's what you want.

1615
01:25:53,769 --> 01:25:54,597
It's up to you.

1616
01:25:57,462 --> 01:25:58,601
- Dr. Brower.

1617
01:26:01,570 --> 01:26:03,537
I am Meg Holmes.

1618
01:26:03,572 --> 01:26:04,435
- Dr. Holmes.

1619
01:26:05,988 --> 01:26:07,023
Yeah.

1620
01:26:07,058 --> 01:26:08,024
The CEO.

1621
01:26:09,025 --> 01:26:11,200
I uh, must be important.

1622
01:26:11,235 --> 01:26:12,546
- Very important to us.

1623
01:26:12,581 --> 01:26:13,685
And thanks so much,

1624
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,549
so much, for being here.

1625
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:19,104
I'm glad we were able
to come to an agreement

1626
01:26:19,139 --> 01:26:20,313
to support your work.

1627
01:26:23,143 --> 01:26:24,386
- Support my work.

1628
01:26:26,008 --> 01:26:27,458
That's surprising.

1629
01:26:27,492 --> 01:26:30,599
I didn't know you'd taken
much interest in it before.

1630
01:26:30,633 --> 01:26:33,188
- We only learned recently
how much good it can do.

1631
01:26:37,675 --> 01:26:40,643
- Dr. Holmes, with respect,
may I ask you something?

1632
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:44,613
Why ignore my data?

1633
01:26:44,647 --> 01:26:48,410
You read the report, you,
you know what happens.

1634
01:26:48,444 --> 01:26:50,032
Klaralon doesn't work.

1635
01:26:53,932 --> 01:26:55,693
- Let's say it doesn't work.

1636
01:26:56,659 --> 01:26:58,143
What then?

1637
01:26:58,178 --> 01:26:59,697
- Then why make it?

1638
01:26:59,731 --> 01:27:01,250
- Because it will work.

1639
01:27:01,285 --> 01:27:03,321
It will, in time.

1640
01:27:03,356 --> 01:27:07,463
- You're a scientist, you
can't sign your name to a lie.

1641
01:27:07,498 --> 01:27:08,637
- It's not a lie.

1642
01:27:08,671 --> 01:27:09,983
It's a step on the path.

1643
01:27:11,156 --> 01:27:14,263
I am here operating
in the real world,

1644
01:27:14,298 --> 01:27:17,577
and if Klaralon is even
1% better than oxycodone,

1645
01:27:17,611 --> 01:27:19,993
then that's 1% that
can change the world.

1646
01:27:21,166 --> 01:27:23,168
You will never change
demand or behavior.

1647
01:27:24,549 --> 01:27:26,827
But you will fund continued
research through these products

1648
01:27:26,862 --> 01:27:28,173
and take a step closer

1649
01:27:28,208 --> 01:27:29,865
to the ultimate
breakthrough that will come.

1650
01:27:29,899 --> 01:27:31,729
- That's not my world.

1651
01:27:31,763 --> 01:27:33,248
That's a cause.

1652
01:27:33,282 --> 01:27:35,215
I don't deal in causes.

1653
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,768
- But somebody has to.
- I deal in science.

1654
01:27:36,803 --> 01:27:37,942
I deal in truth.

1655
01:27:37,976 --> 01:27:40,185
- And what precisely
is that truth?

1656
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:41,773
You think you get to
make that decision,

1657
01:27:41,808 --> 01:27:43,499
along with all the
collateral damage

1658
01:27:43,534 --> 01:27:45,087
it might bring with it?

1659
01:27:45,121 --> 01:27:47,848
What about the millions
in pain who need this drug

1660
01:27:47,883 --> 01:27:50,437
to ease their suffering
and use it legitimately?

1661
01:27:51,783 --> 01:27:54,096
Should they be denied
care because you say so?

1662
01:27:55,787 --> 01:27:58,169
- You're holding up
one animal study,

1663
01:27:58,203 --> 01:28:00,309
one highly questionable study,

1664
01:28:00,344 --> 01:28:01,759
while even you yourself know

1665
01:28:01,793 --> 01:28:06,557
that 65% of these animal studies
don't translate to humans.

1666
01:28:06,591 --> 01:28:10,457
And for that you wanna destroy
a chance at real relief?

1667
01:28:11,665 --> 01:28:13,771
If that's not a cause,
I don't know what is.

1668
01:28:26,473 --> 01:28:27,440
- I can't do it.

1669
01:28:31,996 --> 01:28:33,066
I won't do it.

1670
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,401
[muffled rock music]

1671
01:29:00,127 --> 01:29:00,956
- Jake.

1672
01:29:01,991 --> 01:29:03,061
No Labatt tonight?

1673
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:05,029
- No.

1674
01:29:05,995 --> 01:29:07,411
Just whiskey.

1675
01:29:07,445 --> 01:29:08,515
- Takes all kinds.

1676
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,312
- We all set for tomorrow?

1677
01:29:13,417 --> 01:29:16,420
- Of course we
are, what we said.

1678
01:29:16,454 --> 01:29:17,317
- Good.

1679
01:29:18,801 --> 01:29:20,493
So, where's the meet?

1680
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:23,772
- We still work out
a safe place for you.

1681
01:29:23,806 --> 01:29:25,877
I'll tell you tomorrow, Correc'?

1682
01:29:28,017 --> 01:29:29,122
- And you'll be there?

1683
01:29:30,572 --> 01:29:31,780
'Cause I'll be there.

1684
01:29:33,229 --> 01:29:35,128
And I'm not handing
all of my fucking money

1685
01:29:35,162 --> 01:29:37,026
to somebody I never met before.

1686
01:29:38,614 --> 01:29:40,789
- What, you worry I set you up?

1687
01:29:40,823 --> 01:29:41,617
Is that it?

1688
01:29:43,239 --> 01:29:44,827
Or maybe you set me up.

1689
01:29:47,692 --> 01:29:49,453
It's a crazy business we choose.

1690
01:29:51,316 --> 01:29:52,145
- Crazy.

1691
01:29:54,492 --> 01:29:57,150
- I guess we'll
find out tomorrow.

1692
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:59,152
[laughing] Of course
I'll be there.

1693
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:03,121
You wanna eat something?

1694
01:30:03,156 --> 01:30:05,158
We make a good steak here.

1695
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:06,021
- No.

1696
01:30:06,953 --> 01:30:07,712
I'm going home.

1697
01:30:07,747 --> 01:30:08,610
I'm going to bed.

1698
01:30:10,646 --> 01:30:11,475
Tomorrow.

1699
01:30:50,548 --> 01:30:51,549
Excuse me, miss.

1700
01:30:51,584 --> 01:30:52,654
Can I help you?

1701
01:30:52,688 --> 01:30:53,482
- No, I'm fine.

1702
01:30:53,517 --> 01:30:55,001
Thank you.

1703
01:30:55,035 --> 01:30:55,829
Oh.

1704
01:30:55,864 --> 01:30:57,072
What?

1705
01:30:57,106 --> 01:30:58,901
- Ms. Reimann, whatever
you're looking for,

1706
01:30:58,936 --> 01:31:00,316
you are not gonna
find it in there.

1707
01:31:00,351 --> 01:31:01,835
- What? [groans]

1708
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:04,320
- I suggest that you go home.

1709
01:31:06,115 --> 01:31:07,703
Go all the way home.

1710
01:31:08,566 --> 01:31:10,913
- How do you know who I am?

1711
01:31:10,948 --> 01:31:12,432
- It doesn't matter.

1712
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,262
All that matters is that no
one wants to see you dead.

1713
01:31:15,297 --> 01:31:16,125
Go home.

1714
01:31:18,611 --> 01:31:20,302
- Okay. [breathing heavily]

1715
01:31:20,336 --> 01:31:21,752
Oh, god.

1716
01:31:21,786 --> 01:31:22,615
Oh, god.

1717
01:31:35,559 --> 01:31:37,733
[sobbing]

1718
01:31:45,776 --> 01:31:48,157
- In light of the
evidence presented

1719
01:31:48,192 --> 01:31:50,988
and the university's
zero tolerance position

1720
01:31:51,022 --> 01:31:52,368
on sexual harassment,

1721
01:31:53,577 --> 01:31:55,820
the chair feels that
we have no choice

1722
01:31:55,855 --> 01:31:59,065
but to recommend that Dr.
Brower's tenure be revoked

1723
01:31:59,099 --> 01:32:00,584
and that his employment
at the university

1724
01:32:00,618 --> 01:32:03,172
be terminated
effective immediately.

1725
01:32:03,207 --> 01:32:04,449
All those in favor?

1726
01:32:08,557 --> 01:32:09,385
Opposed?

1727
01:32:11,146 --> 01:32:12,043
The ayes have it.

1728
01:32:13,044 --> 01:32:14,874
This concludes our proceedings.

1729
01:32:14,908 --> 01:32:17,980
[papers shuffling]

1730
01:32:18,015 --> 01:32:21,915
[committee chattering quietly]

1731
01:32:39,830 --> 01:32:42,660
[phone vibrating]

1732
01:33:18,316 --> 01:33:21,734
[agents speaking French]

1733
01:33:23,805 --> 01:33:28,154
- What did you just say?
- I told him to move closer.

1734
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:55,043
- Where's Mother?

1735
01:33:56,009 --> 01:33:57,252
- Don't worry about it.

1736
01:33:57,286 --> 01:33:58,425
You're dealing with us.

1737
01:34:01,118 --> 01:34:02,291
- No.

1738
01:34:02,326 --> 01:34:03,638
No Mother, no deal.

1739
01:34:08,573 --> 01:34:09,436
- Jake!

1740
01:34:11,128 --> 01:34:12,094
Where you going?

1741
01:34:13,233 --> 01:34:15,132
- What is this, a joke?

1742
01:34:15,166 --> 01:34:17,513
[Mother speaking French]

1743
01:34:17,548 --> 01:34:18,791
- Come back here.

1744
01:34:25,729 --> 01:34:29,111
[Mother speaking French]

1745
01:34:34,772 --> 01:34:37,292
- Is this everything?
- Mm-hmm.

1746
01:34:38,327 --> 01:34:39,915
- Do you mind?
- Mm.

1747
01:34:55,655 --> 01:34:58,485
[bottle rattling]

1748
01:35:13,638 --> 01:35:14,467
Okay.

1749
01:35:16,641 --> 01:35:18,264
Where's the rest?

1750
01:35:18,298 --> 01:35:20,300
- What, you don't trust
me anymore, Mother?

1751
01:35:22,337 --> 01:35:24,304
- This is Montreal, my friend.

1752
01:35:25,167 --> 01:35:27,791
Strange things happen here.

1753
01:35:27,825 --> 01:35:29,068
- That's $1 million.

1754
01:35:29,102 --> 01:35:30,552
That's my deposit,
like we discussed.

1755
01:35:30,586 --> 01:35:31,380
Now what's gonna happen is-
[guns cocking]

1756
01:35:31,415 --> 01:35:33,382
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1757
01:35:33,417 --> 01:35:34,729
I'm reaching for my phone.

1758
01:35:35,695 --> 01:35:37,248
All right, everybody calm down.

1759
01:35:38,871 --> 01:35:40,493
Now I text my guys.

1760
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:43,289
- All right, we move when
they come in with the cash.

1761
01:35:43,323 --> 01:35:45,601
- Then they're gonna park
two trucks down at the end

1762
01:35:45,636 --> 01:35:46,602
and your goons are
gonna help them

1763
01:35:46,637 --> 01:35:48,052
load up all these pallets.

1764
01:35:48,087 --> 01:35:50,434
After that-
[rumbling]

1765
01:35:50,468 --> 01:35:51,642
[Mother speaking French]

1766
01:35:51,676 --> 01:35:52,988
- Tell your man to
stand down, right now.

1767
01:35:53,023 --> 01:35:54,231
- I want a better view

1768
01:35:54,265 --> 01:35:55,335
if we're gonna send
our guys in there.

1769
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:56,716
- You heard that?

1770
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:57,544
[indistinct]

1771
01:35:57,579 --> 01:35:58,753
Check it out.

1772
01:35:58,787 --> 01:35:59,857
- What the hell is
going on here, Mother?

1773
01:35:59,892 --> 01:36:01,479
- We wait one minute, okay?

1774
01:36:01,514 --> 01:36:02,998
- No, no more minutes.

1775
01:36:03,033 --> 01:36:05,483
My guys come in and we
do the switch right now!

1776
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:12,525
[gunshots]
[shouting in French]

1777
01:36:13,112 --> 01:36:15,804
[gunshot]

1778
01:36:15,839 --> 01:36:17,219
[sirens blaring]

1779
01:36:17,254 --> 01:36:18,289
- Go, go, go!

1780
01:36:18,324 --> 01:36:21,776
Go out!
[shouting in French]

1781
01:36:21,810 --> 01:36:26,781
[Mother speaking French]
[officers speaking French]

1782
01:36:30,646 --> 01:36:33,304
[Jake groaning]

1783
01:36:41,485 --> 01:36:43,728
[gunshots]

1784
01:36:45,661 --> 01:36:48,733
[shouting in French]

1785
01:37:02,886 --> 01:37:06,475
[officers speaking French]

1786
01:37:21,939 --> 01:37:24,804
[Jake groaning]

1787
01:37:24,839 --> 01:37:27,082
[gunshots]

1788
01:37:29,326 --> 01:37:32,639
- [Stan] Freeze, motherfucker!

1789
01:37:32,674 --> 01:37:34,883
[gunshots]

1790
01:37:37,023 --> 01:37:41,510
- No!
[gunshots]

1791
01:37:44,168 --> 01:37:45,066
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1792
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:46,722
[Stan groaning]

1793
01:37:46,757 --> 01:37:47,862
No, no, no.

1794
01:37:47,896 --> 01:37:48,690
No, no, no.

1795
01:37:48,724 --> 01:37:49,518
No!

1796
01:37:49,553 --> 01:37:50,692
Look at me, it's okay!

1797
01:37:50,726 --> 01:37:51,520
Man down!

1798
01:37:51,555 --> 01:37:52,383
Man down!

1799
01:37:53,695 --> 01:37:54,903
Oh, goddamn.

1800
01:37:54,938 --> 01:37:56,042
Help!

1801
01:37:56,077 --> 01:37:56,905
Help!

1802
01:38:12,714 --> 01:38:15,786
- The division takes the
opioid crisis very seriously.

1803
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,444
As the president
himself has said,

1804
01:38:18,478 --> 01:38:21,481
there is no greater scourge
facing America from within.

1805
01:38:21,516 --> 01:38:22,827
- Well, I still fail to see

1806
01:38:22,862 --> 01:38:24,864
how a breakthrough
drug, like Klaralon,

1807
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:26,866
despite the purported
implications

1808
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:28,833
of Dr. Brower's so-called tests-

1809
01:38:28,868 --> 01:38:30,801
- Mr. Chairman, respectfully,

1810
01:38:30,835 --> 01:38:32,907
Dr. Brower's implications
are more than purported.

1811
01:38:32,941 --> 01:38:34,494
- According to Dr.
Brower's own report,

1812
01:38:34,529 --> 01:38:36,082
he exceeded the
study parameters.

1813
01:38:36,117 --> 01:38:37,497
- And that's precisely
why he was able

1814
01:38:37,532 --> 01:38:38,878
to find the results he did.

1815
01:38:38,913 --> 01:38:40,328
I think we should
hear from Dr. Brower.

1816
01:38:40,362 --> 01:38:41,812
- One moment, please.

1817
01:38:41,846 --> 01:38:43,055
- Okay, are we talking about
a [indistinct] shutdown?

1818
01:38:43,089 --> 01:38:45,402
[indistinct]

1819
01:38:45,436 --> 01:38:47,162
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

1820
01:38:49,337 --> 01:38:51,546
- Thank you, Dr. Brower,
that won't be necessary.

1821
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:53,065
The division has
discussed the matter

1822
01:38:53,099 --> 01:38:54,618
and is prepared to
make a decision.

1823
01:38:54,652 --> 01:38:55,826
- Mr. Chairman, I object
to a decision without-

1824
01:38:55,860 --> 01:38:58,311
- That's enough, Mr. Walker.

1825
01:38:58,346 --> 01:39:00,589
The division has
read the evidence

1826
01:39:00,624 --> 01:39:02,695
and it is our position
that the benefits

1827
01:39:02,729 --> 01:39:06,354
of the item outweigh
these potential risks.

1828
01:39:06,388 --> 01:39:10,151
FDA approval for
Klaralon will proceed.

1829
01:39:10,185 --> 01:39:12,291
Northlight Pharmaceuticals
will arrange a fund

1830
01:39:12,325 --> 01:39:14,051
for further studies of addiction

1831
01:39:14,086 --> 01:39:15,984
in the amount of $11 million.

1832
01:39:16,019 --> 01:39:17,296
Do you all agree?

1833
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:18,159
- [Division Members] Agreed.

1834
01:39:18,193 --> 01:39:19,677
- Mr. Chairman.

1835
01:39:19,712 --> 01:39:21,921
Mr. Chairman, at
least let me speak!

1836
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:23,267
- Sorry, Dr. Brower.

1837
01:39:23,302 --> 01:39:24,579
Meeting is adjourned.

1838
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:28,341
[slow music]

1839
01:39:30,274 --> 01:39:33,898
[group chattering quietly]

1840
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:00,132
- What happened?

1841
01:40:00,166 --> 01:40:01,685
- I've been reassigned.

1842
01:40:03,307 --> 01:40:05,930
[Tyrone sighs]

1843
01:40:11,902 --> 01:40:13,041
- So, that's it?

1844
01:40:13,076 --> 01:40:13,938
It's over?

1845
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:17,252
There's gotta be another way.

1846
01:40:18,357 --> 01:40:20,117
- I've been thinking.

1847
01:40:20,152 --> 01:40:21,532
There's someone you can talk to,

1848
01:40:21,567 --> 01:40:24,052
but without the
committee's protection,

1849
01:40:24,087 --> 01:40:26,710
you'd have to violate
your non-disclosure.

1850
01:40:26,744 --> 01:40:27,711
- And?

1851
01:40:27,745 --> 01:40:29,402
- And if it goes
bad for you now,

1852
01:40:29,437 --> 01:40:32,060
we're talking debts
surviving bankruptcy.

1853
01:40:32,095 --> 01:40:34,476
You'd probably still be
paying in the afterlife.

1854
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:38,377
- Well, I got nothing now,

1855
01:40:39,826 --> 01:40:42,553
so what difference
would it make?

1856
01:40:44,038 --> 01:40:46,971
[bubbling]

1857
01:40:47,006 --> 01:40:50,665
[Emmie breathing heavily]

1858
01:40:50,699 --> 01:40:51,493
- Jake.

1859
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:54,255
It's your sister.

1860
01:40:57,637 --> 01:41:02,194
I just wanted to say I'm
really sorry for the other day,

1861
01:41:03,298 --> 01:41:08,062
and I'm feeling much better now.

1862
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:13,826
I love you so much.

1863
01:41:24,768 --> 01:41:26,080
- [RCMP Chief] We're
still ID-ing the bodies,

1864
01:41:26,114 --> 01:41:27,184
but from what we can tell,

1865
01:41:27,219 --> 01:41:29,221
they were low-level muscle.

1866
01:41:29,255 --> 01:41:31,119
No traffickers.

1867
01:41:31,154 --> 01:41:32,327
- What about Mother?

1868
01:41:32,362 --> 01:41:34,329
- Apparently he's got
some family in Algiers,

1869
01:41:34,364 --> 01:41:35,779
so we put some men
on the airports,

1870
01:41:35,813 --> 01:41:38,506
but we're not gonna
see him again.

1871
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:40,059
How about the Armenians?

1872
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:43,131
- Prosecutor says he doesn't
have enough to charge them.

1873
01:41:43,166 --> 01:41:44,305
- What?

1874
01:41:44,339 --> 01:41:45,306
- They never set
foot in the building,

1875
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:46,548
let alone the lot.

1876
01:41:46,583 --> 01:41:48,688
There's no overt act.

1877
01:41:48,723 --> 01:41:50,690
- We'll issue a Red
Notice for Mother,

1878
01:41:50,725 --> 01:41:53,762
but beyond that my superiors
wanna terminate cooperation.

1879
01:41:53,797 --> 01:41:55,799
- Yeah, mine too.

1880
01:41:55,833 --> 01:41:56,627
- So, that's it?

1881
01:41:57,594 --> 01:41:58,974
You're just gonna quit?

1882
01:41:59,009 --> 01:41:59,906
- Calm down, Jake.

1883
01:41:59,941 --> 01:42:01,805
- Two crown officers are dead.

1884
01:42:01,839 --> 01:42:04,704
My department won't risk
any more loss of life.

1885
01:42:04,739 --> 01:42:05,809
I'm sorry.

1886
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:13,851
- Agent Kelly.

1887
01:42:16,958 --> 01:42:17,959
- What?

1888
01:42:17,993 --> 01:42:19,167
What do you want me to say?

1889
01:42:19,202 --> 01:42:20,582
What do you want from me?

1890
01:42:20,617 --> 01:42:23,516
- I want you to calm
down and be professional.

1891
01:42:23,551 --> 01:42:24,552
- Professional what?

1892
01:42:24,586 --> 01:42:26,105
Agent or drug dealer?

1893
01:42:27,175 --> 01:42:28,521
You realize how fucked this is?

1894
01:42:28,556 --> 01:42:29,936
- Yeah, I do.

1895
01:42:29,971 --> 01:42:32,732
I'm the one who had
to call Stan's wife.

1896
01:42:32,767 --> 01:42:34,148
He was my friend, too.

1897
01:42:37,530 --> 01:42:38,359
- I'm sorry.

1898
01:42:39,532 --> 01:42:41,293
- What do you think
we're here to do?

1899
01:42:41,327 --> 01:42:42,811
To make a difference?

1900
01:42:42,846 --> 01:42:44,986
- So, what are we here to do?

1901
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:46,470
- Our job.

1902
01:42:46,505 --> 01:42:48,852
As mandated by the people.

1903
01:42:48,886 --> 01:42:52,131
- So, we're just here
to clean up, is that it?

1904
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:54,375
I don't accept that.

1905
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:55,583
- That's not fair, Jake.

1906
01:42:57,101 --> 01:42:58,896
You're a good agent.

1907
01:42:58,931 --> 01:43:00,691
We fight the best we can.

1908
01:43:02,728 --> 01:43:04,626
- I'll see you at the airport.

1909
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:07,767
[slow intense music]

1910
01:43:09,942 --> 01:43:10,770
- Fuck.

1911
01:43:19,089 --> 01:43:20,401
- [Jim] Hello, Ms. Reimann?

1912
01:43:20,435 --> 01:43:23,231
This is Jim Douglas,
Douglas Investigations.

1913
01:43:23,266 --> 01:43:26,993
I'm just following up on that
individual that we spoke of.

1914
01:43:27,028 --> 01:43:27,994
You asked me to let you know

1915
01:43:28,029 --> 01:43:30,342
if I had any new information.

1916
01:43:30,376 --> 01:43:33,966
Well, I think you might
be interested in this.

1917
01:44:01,718 --> 01:44:04,099
- Where's Mother?
[bartender speaking French]

1918
01:44:04,134 --> 01:44:06,378
I will blow your head all
over this fucking bar.

1919
01:44:06,412 --> 01:44:07,586
Where's Mother?

1920
01:44:07,620 --> 01:44:09,243
- [speaking French]
I don't know!

1921
01:44:11,175 --> 01:44:12,660
- Last chance.

1922
01:44:12,694 --> 01:44:15,835
- He keeps a seaplane by
the Dwyer shipping yard.

1923
01:44:15,870 --> 01:44:17,043
That's all I know.

1924
01:44:17,078 --> 01:44:18,597
- If I find out
you're lying to me-

1925
01:44:18,631 --> 01:44:19,736
- It's the truth!

1926
01:44:19,770 --> 01:44:20,875
I swear it!

1927
01:45:58,144 --> 01:45:58,973
- Mother!

1928
01:46:03,115 --> 01:46:06,049
[gunshots]

1929
01:46:06,083 --> 01:46:08,741
[Claire groans]

1930
01:46:12,193 --> 01:46:12,987
- Hey, hey, hey.

1931
01:46:13,021 --> 01:46:14,402
Hey.
- What?

1932
01:46:14,437 --> 01:46:15,921
- It's okay, hey, relax.

1933
01:46:15,955 --> 01:46:17,025
Relax, relax.
- Get away from me!

1934
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:17,854
- I'm a federal agent.

1935
01:46:17,888 --> 01:46:18,786
I'm a federal agent.

1936
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:19,649
It's okay.

1937
01:46:20,546 --> 01:46:21,409
It's okay.

1938
01:46:21,444 --> 01:46:22,376
It's okay.

1939
01:46:22,410 --> 01:46:23,894
Let me see.

1940
01:46:23,929 --> 01:46:24,826
Fuck. Okay.

1941
01:46:24,861 --> 01:46:25,827
It just went through your arm.

1942
01:46:25,862 --> 01:46:26,759
You're gonna be okay.

1943
01:46:26,794 --> 01:46:27,726
Come on.

1944
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:30,418
[Claire groans]

1945
01:46:32,972 --> 01:46:33,801
It's okay.

1946
01:46:34,871 --> 01:46:35,941
There you go.

1947
01:46:45,571 --> 01:46:46,641
Stay right here.

1948
01:46:46,676 --> 01:46:48,574
I'll be right back.
[exhales]

1949
01:47:28,234 --> 01:47:30,409
[gunshot]

1950
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:04,408
[doorbell ringing]

1951
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:11,277
- [Geoff] Already?

1952
01:48:12,658 --> 01:48:16,282
- [Tyrone] The university
gave us three days to vacate.

1953
01:48:16,317 --> 01:48:19,009
- Where to?
- I don't know.

1954
01:48:20,597 --> 01:48:22,634
- How long did we
work together, Tyrone?

1955
01:48:22,668 --> 01:48:23,876
- A long time.

1956
01:48:23,911 --> 01:48:27,328
- And in that time,
didn't I support you,

1957
01:48:27,362 --> 01:48:31,539
and champion your labs,
and find you grant money

1958
01:48:31,574 --> 01:48:32,989
wherever the hell I could,

1959
01:48:34,128 --> 01:48:36,199
help keep your whole
field of research alive?

1960
01:48:36,233 --> 01:48:39,236
- Yeah, yeah, you
did all of that.

1961
01:48:39,271 --> 01:48:42,481
- Whatever I did, I never
compromised our university.

1962
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:44,069
And I never compromised
our students.

1963
01:48:44,103 --> 01:48:46,692
- Geoff, all you
did was compromise.

1964
01:48:46,727 --> 01:48:49,937
You had the facts and you
just didn't look at them.

1965
01:48:49,971 --> 01:48:52,905
You stood there while
they made you complicit.

1966
01:48:52,940 --> 01:48:56,081
- I spent a lifetime
building that school.

1967
01:48:56,115 --> 01:48:58,566
That I should take a
moment before deciding

1968
01:48:58,601 --> 01:48:59,809
whether or not to destroy it

1969
01:48:59,843 --> 01:49:01,604
supporting your
half-baked research

1970
01:49:01,638 --> 01:49:03,088
against a drug monolith.

1971
01:49:03,122 --> 01:49:04,330
- What about the people,

1972
01:49:04,365 --> 01:49:06,229
the ones that we're
supposed to serve,

1973
01:49:06,263 --> 01:49:08,265
the ones who can't
speak for themselves?

1974
01:49:14,651 --> 01:49:16,411
- It's the Detroit Evening News.

1975
01:49:19,311 --> 01:49:21,106
You gave them the
whole story, huh?

1976
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:24,661
Even everything that
happened between us.

1977
01:49:25,628 --> 01:49:26,905
I thought we were friends.

1978
01:49:27,871 --> 01:49:28,700
- So did I.

1979
01:49:30,356 --> 01:49:31,426
- You know this isn't gonna make

1980
01:49:31,461 --> 01:49:33,428
a damn bit of difference
to Northlight.

1981
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:36,604
They've got their approval.

1982
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:38,157
They'll still put
their drug out.

1983
01:49:38,192 --> 01:49:39,538
- But the people will know.

1984
01:49:40,919 --> 01:49:42,472
They'll know.

1985
01:49:42,506 --> 01:49:44,025
And that's the best I could do.

1986
01:49:46,441 --> 01:49:48,616
- I've been asked to resign.

1987
01:49:48,651 --> 01:49:49,444
- I'm sorry.

1988
01:49:50,342 --> 01:49:51,895
- Me, too.

1989
01:49:51,930 --> 01:49:53,587
If I could do it all over again.

1990
01:49:55,623 --> 01:49:56,451
Oh.

1991
01:49:57,660 --> 01:50:00,248
What difference does it make?

1992
01:50:00,283 --> 01:50:01,215
Bye, Tyrone.

1993
01:50:08,291 --> 01:50:10,707
[slow music]

1994
01:50:26,136 --> 01:50:29,139
- Hopefully it looks
like two gangsters

1995
01:50:29,174 --> 01:50:31,107
killed each other
for a million dollars

1996
01:50:32,418 --> 01:50:33,799
and no one looks any deeper.

1997
01:50:36,699 --> 01:50:38,286
- Didn't you say you were a cop?

1998
01:50:39,529 --> 01:50:40,323
- I was.

1999
01:50:42,946 --> 01:50:45,224
- [Claire] So are you
taking me to prison now?

2000
01:50:49,988 --> 01:50:50,782
- No.

2001
01:50:52,128 --> 01:50:52,922
- Why not?

2002
01:50:57,823 --> 01:50:59,376
- You remind me of someone.

2003
01:51:03,001 --> 01:51:05,003
[Claire gasps]
- Sorry.

2004
01:51:05,037 --> 01:51:05,866
I'm sorry.

2005
01:51:08,006 --> 01:51:12,079
- [exhaling] I don't understand.

2006
01:51:13,252 --> 01:51:15,530
So, what am I
supposed to do now?

2007
01:51:19,845 --> 01:51:20,674
- I don't know.

2008
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,348
- Thank you.

2009
01:51:51,187 --> 01:51:53,327
- And given the doctor's
ongoing press schedule

2010
01:51:53,361 --> 01:51:55,053
that you may have heard about,

2011
01:51:55,087 --> 01:51:56,779
if any of you ever get out

2012
01:51:56,813 --> 01:51:59,022
of your labs long enough
to read the paper,

2013
01:51:59,057 --> 01:51:59,954
[students laughing]

2014
01:51:59,989 --> 01:52:01,887
we were very lucky to get him.

2015
01:52:01,922 --> 01:52:04,959
So, I hope you'll all
join me in welcoming

2016
01:52:04,994 --> 01:52:07,203
our new co-chair of biology

2017
01:52:07,237 --> 01:52:09,757
here at University of Michigan.

2018
01:52:09,792 --> 01:52:13,243
Dr. Tyrone Brower.
[applauding]

2019
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:16,730
- Thank you!

2020
01:52:19,387 --> 01:52:22,874
Thank you, and welcome to
my class... [intense music]

2021
01:56:18,247 --> 01:56:21,836
[intense electronic music]
