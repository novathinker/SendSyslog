00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:05,668
Okay, Jackie,

3
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:06,936
All right.

4
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,307
Here you go, my friend.

5
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:12,009
Hey, yo, Jackie.

6
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:13,244
Hey, Sal.

7
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,612
What's up, man?
How you doing?

8
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:15,613
All right.
How you doing?

9
00:03:15,678 --> 00:03:17,114
- Good to see ya.
- You too.

10
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:18,948
Yeah, what's going on?
Where's your turkey today?

11
00:03:19,016 --> 00:03:20,217
Uh, my sister's house.

12
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:21,519
My mom just moved in
over there,

13
00:03:21,585 --> 00:03:22,586
so we're doing Thanksgiving.

14
00:03:22,652 --> 00:03:23,820
Oh, nice, man. Nice.

15
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:25,322
Well, say hi to your mom
and Beth for me.

16
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:27,324
I will. You still reffin'
the Catholic League games?

17
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:28,626
Little bit, here and there.

18
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,060
Yeah, my oldest
is at UC Santa Cruz.

19
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,928
So, you know,
every little bit helps, right?

20
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:33,730
You bet.
Well, happy Thanksgiving.

21
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,065
Happy Thanksgiving, Jackie.
Good seeing ya.

22
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,600
- You too, Sal.
- What's up, man?

23
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:37,901
Give me a couple
of scratch-offs, please.

24
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:38,969
- Sure.
- Thank you.

25
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:05,329
Don't fill up on bread.

26
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:07,864
You gotta eat
the rest of your beans. Okay?

27
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,500
Hey! Happy Thanksgiving.

28
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:11,035
- Hey, Uncle Jack's here!
- Look who's here.

29
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:12,069
Hey.
Happy Thanksgiving to you.

30
00:04:12,136 --> 00:04:13,470
How you doing, man?

31
00:04:13,537 --> 00:04:14,771
Glad you could make it.

32
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,373
No problem.
How's the car business?

33
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,541
It is going good.

34
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:18,509
- Thank you for asking.
- Good.

35
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:19,742
Would you like some wine?

36
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,512
No. I have some.
Thank you very much.

37
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,779
Hi, Uncle Fart-Poop.

38
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,249
Uncle Fart-Poop!

39
00:04:26,716 --> 00:04:28,052
Don't tickle me!
No, no, no.

40
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:29,420
- Uncle Jack's getting tickled.
- Hi, sweetheart.

41
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:30,787
- Hi, Mom.
- Mmm.

42
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,989
- Hello, sweetheart.
- All right. Good.

43
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:33,324
- Hey. Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi.

44
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,025
- Sorry I'm late.
- Really?

45
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:36,026
Yeah.

46
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,194
Some people call
when they're late.

47
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:38,828
I didn't have
my phone with me.

48
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:40,897
Oh. Well,
then why have a phone

49
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:42,233
if you're not gonna use it?

50
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,467
I don't know.
That's a good question.

51
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,535
How you doing, buddy?

52
00:04:44,602 --> 00:04:46,003
- I'm good.
- Good to see you.

53
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,770
I don't understand
why somebody has a phone

54
00:04:47,837 --> 00:04:49,173
if they don't ever answer it.

55
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,608
Can I have
some of those potatoes, Mom?

56
00:04:50,674 --> 00:04:51,542
Do you want
some potatoes?

57
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:53,177
Thank you so much.

58
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:54,478
<i>Did your mom ever
tell you about our fish tank</i>

59
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,447
- when we were kids?
- No.

60
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,983
Well, your grandmother
took us to the pet store

61
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,150
and we got a fish tank,

62
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,452
you know,
a bunch of cool fish.

63
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:03,721
And I came from school
the next day,

64
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:05,788
and the fish tank
was filled with shampoo.

65
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:07,625
And all the fish were dead.

66
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,891
And your mom was there crying.

67
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,261
And Grandma said,

68
00:05:10,327 --> 00:05:11,395
"Why'd you put shampoo
in the fish tank?"

69
00:05:11,462 --> 00:05:12,663
And your mom said,

70
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,564
"I wanted to give
the fish a bubble bath."

71
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:17,568
Why'd she give
the fish a bubble bath?

72
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:20,004
You're gonna have to ask
your mom. I don't know.

73
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,039
I guess she always wanted
to take care of everybody.

74
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,742
Mwah. I love you.

75
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:26,277
Don't let your mom
near those fish.

76
00:05:27,777 --> 00:05:29,413
Good night, Uncle Jack.

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,880
Good night, chief.

78
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:36,520
Hey.

79
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:37,787
Hey.

80
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,093
How's Mom, uh, settling in?

81
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,131
Uh, good. Yeah, really good.
She seems to be.

82
00:05:47,197 --> 00:05:48,865
Can't believe
you got her outta Seaside.

83
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,068
Right? It's different now.

84
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:53,604
It's just all,
like, young kids...

85
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,973
- Yeah.
- ...and little couples...

86
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,975
running around, families.

87
00:05:58,042 --> 00:06:00,210
I think she was feeling
like a castaway out there.

88
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:04,048
Yeah, you did good.
I'm glad she's here.

89
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:06,984
What's going on with you?
What's new?

90
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:09,186
Not much.

91
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:11,989
Are you seeing anybody?

92
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,559
No.

93
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,428
I wish you would.

94
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:19,029
I really do.

95
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:20,698
I would feel much better.

96
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:21,999
I hate the idea of you

97
00:06:22,066 --> 00:06:23,200
down there by yourself
all the time.

98
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,002
What do you hate
about it so much?

99
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,805
That you're,
you know, just alone.

100
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,308
Just drinking
all the time and...

101
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:32,543
I'm fine.

102
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:35,546
I appreciate it.
But it's... I'm fine.

103
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:46,256
I know that Ang worries
about you, so...

104
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,525
What does Ang
have to do with it?

105
00:06:48,592 --> 00:06:51,128
Why do you know
what Ang would worry about?

106
00:06:51,195 --> 00:06:52,529
Because she called

107
00:06:52,596 --> 00:06:54,164
and she wanted to see
how you were doing.

108
00:06:54,231 --> 00:06:56,100
- She called you?
- Yeah.

109
00:06:57,768 --> 00:06:59,069
- Why?
- Is that okay?

110
00:06:59,136 --> 00:07:00,437
I don't know.

111
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,904
I mean, what, she called you
to talk about me?

112
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:03,207
Why didn't she just
call me directly?

113
00:07:03,273 --> 00:07:05,442
She just wanted to see
how you're doing.

114
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,846
Well... I...

115
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,214
I'm fine.

116
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:16,653
Look, I know
Kathy Collins says

117
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,057
she sees your car outside
Harold's bar every night.

118
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:22,960
Well, if Kathy Collins
says it,

119
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,228
- must be true.
- Mmm-hmm.

120
00:07:24,294 --> 00:07:26,530
You know that
something must be wrong.

121
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:28,031
So, I go to work,

122
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:29,733
and then after work
sometimes I go have a beer.

123
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,900
I'm just saying...

124
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:31,969
You better start
calling people.

125
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,070
- Okay.
- Better get on

126
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:34,705
- this fucking case.
- Okay.

127
00:07:34,772 --> 00:07:36,373
She has other things maybe
she ought to be worrying about

128
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,075
instead of worrying
about how much I drink.

129
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:39,443
I mean, she needs
to worry about staying out

130
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:41,211
- of her fucking refrigerator.
- Nice.

131
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:42,980
She's losing a huge war
against the refrigerator.

132
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,281
What are you talking about?
Jack...

133
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:45,616
She needs to find
the fucking treadmill.

134
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,885
Stop it. That is so mean.
She's my friend.

135
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:49,353
Well, she should
mind her business.

136
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,687
- Okay.
- That's why I don't come here.

137
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:51,722
'Cause it always turns to...

138
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,326
Which one of the 20 bedrooms

139
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,061
am I supposed to be
staying in?

140
00:07:59,363 --> 00:08:01,331
Take the second one
on the left.

141
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:08,238
Hey, Ang, it's Jack.

142
00:08:08,305 --> 00:08:11,842
I'm just, uh...
Happy Thanksgiving.

143
00:08:13,343 --> 00:08:16,046
I wanted to call you,
see how you're doing.

144
00:08:16,113 --> 00:08:19,949
And also because
my sister told me

145
00:08:20,017 --> 00:08:22,119
that you had called her

146
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:25,589
and wanted to know
how I was doing.

147
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:31,094
I'm just saying, if you want
to know in the future

148
00:08:31,161 --> 00:08:32,729
how I'm doing,

149
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:35,599
you can call me,

150
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:40,704
as I still have
the same phone number

151
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,372
that I had...

152
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,243
when we were married.

153
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:05,462
<i>Hey, Jack, it's Miguel.</i>

154
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,431
<i>Haven't heard from you
for a while, so...</i>

155
00:09:07,498 --> 00:09:09,366
<i>Sofia was asking about you.</i>

156
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,168
<i>Thought I'd give you a call
and see how you're doing.</i>

157
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:12,469
<i>Thought maybe
we'd have you over...</i>

158
00:09:14,505 --> 00:09:16,874
<i>Hello, Jack,
this is Father Edward Devine</i>

159
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,209
<i>calling from
Bishop Hayes High School.</i>

160
00:09:19,276 --> 00:09:21,178
<i>Will you give me a call
back here at the rectory</i>

161
00:09:21,245 --> 00:09:22,479
<i>when you get a chance?</i>

162
00:09:22,546 --> 00:09:27,317
<i>1-424-145-3233.</i>

163
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:29,920
<i>And I'll be up until
about 10:00 this evening.</i>

164
00:09:29,988 --> 00:09:31,956
<i>If that doesn't work,
we can chat in the morning.</i>

165
00:09:32,022 --> 00:09:34,324
<i>Thanks, Jack.
God bless.</i>

166
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:53,377
Hello, Jack.

167
00:09:53,443 --> 00:09:54,511
Hi.

168
00:09:54,578 --> 00:09:56,713
How are you?
Come on in.

169
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,382
Thanks so much.

170
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,285
So, did you have
a nice Thanksgiving?

171
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,452
I did. How about you?

172
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,121
Oh, it was very nice.

173
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,290
All the kids
and the grandkids were in.

174
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:08,725
- I was in my glory.
- I bet.

175
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,128
- Good for you.
- Oh.

176
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,629
You can go right in here.

177
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:17,301
Father Devine
is just finishing up a call.

178
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,170
So, he will be out
in just a couple of minutes,

179
00:10:20,237 --> 00:10:22,072
so just make
yourself comfortable.

180
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,807
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

181
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:27,077
We are all so excited

182
00:10:27,144 --> 00:10:29,913
at the idea
of you possibly coming back

183
00:10:29,981 --> 00:10:32,649
to be with us at Hayes.

184
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,789
It's nice to see you again,
Jack.

185
00:11:17,227 --> 00:11:19,162
Hello, Jack.

186
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:21,565
Hey, Father.

187
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:24,068
It's good to see you.
Thanks for making the drive.

188
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:25,268
Sure. No problem.

189
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:26,770
Sit down, please.

190
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:32,743
So, been a while, hasn't it?

191
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,344
Yeah. Since, uh...

192
00:11:35,178 --> 00:11:36,446
my father's funeral.

193
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:37,848
- That long?
- Mmm.

194
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:40,784
My goodness.
Where does the time go?

195
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:42,954
If I knew, I would tell ya.

196
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:44,454
Married?

197
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:46,857
I'm separated now.
For a while.

198
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,092
Any children?

199
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:49,926
No kids.

200
00:11:49,994 --> 00:11:51,361
Okay.

201
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,597
Well, Jack, it is really good
to see you again.

202
00:11:53,664 --> 00:11:57,035
And I suppose you're wondering
why I called you over here.

203
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,503
I'm a little curious. Yeah.

204
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:01,238
Our basketball coach,
Tom McGarrity,

205
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,706
had a heart attack
the other night.

206
00:12:02,773 --> 00:12:03,774
Oh, no.

207
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,475
He's expected
to make a full recovery,

208
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:07,344
but his wife doesn't think
it's a very good idea

209
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:09,813
for him to return to the team.

210
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,915
And I tend to agree.

211
00:12:11,983 --> 00:12:14,152
We need a new coach, Jack.

212
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:15,719
You're the first person
I thought of.

213
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,692
Try to suppress
your enthusiasm.

214
00:12:21,758 --> 00:12:24,294
No, I appreciate it.
I just... It's, um...

215
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,429
You know, it's just,
I've been away

216
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,863
from the game for a long time.

217
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,331
I understand. I understand.

218
00:12:28,398 --> 00:12:30,434
You know, I've never
even coached before.

219
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,536
I just played, so I don't...

220
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:34,404
Is the, uh... I mean...

221
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,040
Is the team any good?

222
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:37,674
No. No.

223
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:40,711
We haven't been competitive
for quite a while, actually.

224
00:12:40,777 --> 00:12:43,147
In fact, the last time
they made the playoffs?

225
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:44,614
Back when you were playing.

226
00:12:45,615 --> 00:12:46,951
Wow.

227
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:50,088
Well, I really appreciate you
thinking of me, Father.

228
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:51,254
It's just, I...

229
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:52,656
Go home
and think it over, Jack.

230
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:53,757
I got a lot going on
in my life right now.

231
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:54,825
It's very busy.

232
00:12:54,891 --> 00:12:56,560
Go home, think it over.

233
00:12:56,626 --> 00:12:59,097
Call me with your decision
in the morning.

234
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:00,397
Tomorrow morning?

235
00:13:00,464 --> 00:13:02,066
Our next game
is Monday night, Jack.

236
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:03,767
I don't have a lot of time.

237
00:13:09,573 --> 00:13:12,242
<i>Hey, Father,
listen, I...</i>

238
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:14,444
Mmm...
Thank you so much

239
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:17,681
for thinking of me. Um...

240
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:23,587
It's just not the right time
for me to take this on. Um...

241
00:13:23,653 --> 00:13:27,791
You know, my life's very full
right now. Very full.

242
00:13:31,495 --> 00:13:33,064
I just, um...

243
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:36,134
I've just been away from the
game for so long, you know?

244
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,535
I've just been away
from the game for so long.

245
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,609
Father...

246
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:48,945
<i>Listen, I've given it a lot of
thought, and I appreciate it.</i>

247
00:13:49,013 --> 00:13:53,350
<i>It's just not the right time
for me right now.</i>

248
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,219
I've been away from the game
for so long.

249
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:57,621
I don't think I can help you.

250
00:13:58,355 --> 00:14:00,323
I don't think...

251
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,725
I don't think I can help you.

252
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,360
I don't think I can help you.

253
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:10,667
Father. Jack.

254
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,435
Not gonna happen.

255
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:17,975
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

256
00:14:18,042 --> 00:14:19,076
The team can't play.

257
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:20,111
They're no good.
They're no good.

258
00:14:20,178 --> 00:14:21,444
I can't wave a magic wand,

259
00:14:21,511 --> 00:14:22,846
turn them into
fucking Michael Jordan.

260
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:24,347
I mean, just...

261
00:14:28,652 --> 00:14:29,886
<i>I don't know.</i>

262
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,390
<i>Maybe.</i>

263
00:14:34,357 --> 00:14:35,759
I don't know.

264
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,601
<i>I can't help you with this.</i>

265
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:46,803
<i>I can't help you
with this team.</i>

266
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,964
<i>Father, I've given it
a lot of thought.</i>

267
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:15,699
I just have no interest

268
00:15:15,765 --> 00:15:17,834
in coaching
your fucking basketball team.

269
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:22,974
That's all there is to it.

270
00:15:44,494 --> 00:15:45,997
Oh, fuck.

271
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:53,904
Get back on D!

272
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:55,438
Make up for it.

273
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:56,573
What the fuck?

274
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,841
Hey, G. G!

275
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:03,880
D up! Hey, get back!
Let's go! Let's go!

276
00:16:03,947 --> 00:16:06,883
Move! Go quick!
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

277
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,620
Stop him up top.
Chubbs, go to the wing.

278
00:16:10,687 --> 00:16:11,888
Watch it.
Screen, screen, screen.

279
00:16:11,956 --> 00:16:13,723
Yo, get through,
get through.

280
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:15,492
Get through that.

281
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,395
- Hey, Freeze.
- Go!

282
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,096
- Good pass.
- Come on!

283
00:16:19,163 --> 00:16:20,463
- Hey, nice job, D-boy.
- What's up, Chubbs?

284
00:16:21,932 --> 00:16:23,934
Hey, Coach.

285
00:16:24,001 --> 00:16:26,003
Dan Espinosa.
Nice to meet ya.

286
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,671
- You're the assistant?
- I am.

287
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,041
Uh, I also teach algebra
here at the school.

288
00:16:30,107 --> 00:16:32,343
Uh, I really appreciate you
stepping up like this.

289
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,477
It means a lot to the boys.

290
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:35,946
Um, do you want me
to call everybody in,

291
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:37,547
- do some intros?
- No, that's okay. Just, uh...

292
00:16:37,614 --> 00:16:39,216
- Take the layup, Marcus!
- Money!

293
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:41,152
Just get a feel for
what I'm working with here.

294
00:16:41,218 --> 00:16:42,219
Yeah.

295
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:43,486
This the whole team? Ten kids?

296
00:16:43,553 --> 00:16:45,122
That's all we've got.

297
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:47,124
A lot different than
when you played here, huh?

298
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:48,225
Yeah. No shit.

299
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,994
We got 100 kids just try out.

300
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:51,928
104 my senior year.

301
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:52,997
Play ball here?

302
00:16:53,064 --> 00:16:55,099
Well, not like you.

303
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,733
Spent most of my time
on the bench,

304
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,468
holding a clipboard
like I am now.

305
00:16:58,535 --> 00:17:01,172
I was a couple of years
behind you. Uh, class of '98.

306
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:05,309
Enrollment's really taken
a dive since then.

307
00:17:05,376 --> 00:17:06,978
Freeze, Freeze, Freeze!

308
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:08,912
I can run down
the starting five, if you like.

309
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,714
- Box out!
- Sure.

310
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,649
So, uh, the kid with the ball,
that's Brandon Durrett.

311
00:17:12,716 --> 00:17:14,285
Relation to Russ Durrett?

312
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:16,153
Yeah, that's his son.

313
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,455
He's a great player.

314
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,323
Really has a good feel
for the game.

315
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,392
Easily our most talented guy.

316
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:24,462
And then, um, playing
besides him in the backcourt,

317
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:25,997
that's Chubbs Hendricks.

318
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:28,698
His, uh, real name's Ronald.

319
00:17:28,765 --> 00:17:30,533
- Oh, yeah.
- Right here, this man.

320
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,371
And, um,
Kenny Dawes out on the wing.

321
00:17:33,437 --> 00:17:35,839
Bit of a showboat, but, uh...

322
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:37,141
Yeah, he's a solid shooter.

323
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:38,675
- Whoo!
- Good long-range stroke.

324
00:17:38,742 --> 00:17:40,077
Get back! Get back!

325
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,446
And Sam Garcia,
he's our senior captain.

326
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:45,349
Not much of a scoring threat,
but he's a solid defender.

327
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:46,417
Good kid.

328
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:48,085
And then Marcus Parrish.

329
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:49,987
- Money!
- That is our center.

330
00:17:50,054 --> 00:17:51,322
What the fuck
are you doing, bro?

331
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:52,589
That kid's the center?

332
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,590
- Yeah.
- What is he, 6'4"?

333
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:54,858
Shut the fuck up, man.

334
00:17:54,924 --> 00:17:56,127
6'3".

335
00:17:56,193 --> 00:17:57,927
You guys must get murdered
on the boards.

336
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,364
Yeah, it's not
been good at all.

337
00:18:00,431 --> 00:18:02,033
You're giving 'em
open buckets, Marcus.

338
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:03,533
This is practice, man.
I don't care.

339
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,969
Who's that kid there?
The white shadow.

340
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:07,737
Oh, yeah,
that's, uh, Bobby Freeze.

341
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,106
He's our sixth man.

342
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:11,242
He's actually
a starting strong safety

343
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:12,776
for the football team.

344
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,379
Then the rest of the guys, uh,

345
00:18:15,446 --> 00:18:17,947
Dearborn, Daly, Carter,
and Amato.

346
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,682
I had to bring
those guys up from JV

347
00:18:19,749 --> 00:18:21,519
just so we could
hold a practice.

348
00:18:21,584 --> 00:18:22,685
- Take the layup!
- Money!

349
00:18:22,752 --> 00:18:24,522
Come on, box out!

350
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:26,390
All right.
Blow the whistle for me.

351
00:18:26,457 --> 00:18:27,857
- Freeze. Chill out, man.
- Yo, take it easy, man.

352
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:29,193
Stop grabbing me.

353
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,827
That's clean.
That's clean D.

354
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:32,530
Bring it in. Let's go.
Hustle, hustle.

355
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:34,864
All right, guys.
As discussed,

356
00:18:34,931 --> 00:18:38,202
I am honored to turn things
over to your new head coach,

357
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:39,470
Jack Cunningham.

358
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:41,005
What's up, Coach?

359
00:18:41,072 --> 00:18:42,473
- How you doing, guys?
- Good. Good.

360
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,408
What's up, Coach?

361
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:45,976
You're Marcus, right?

362
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,778
That's right. Get used
to calling my name, too.

363
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,049
All right. All right.

364
00:18:52,116 --> 00:18:53,951
Marcus, tell me
what you see out there.

365
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:56,554
Um...

366
00:18:56,619 --> 00:19:00,157
I see Nikki's
fine ass keep looking at me.

367
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,158
Saw she was bending over.

368
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,659
She tryin'
to get my attention.

369
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,361
Marcus,
just be respectful, please.

370
00:19:04,428 --> 00:19:05,862
He asked me what I saw. What,
do you want me to lie to him?

371
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:07,131
- You know what I see, Marcus?
- What?

372
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:08,299
You're the tallest player
on the team.

373
00:19:08,365 --> 00:19:09,799
Oh.

374
00:19:09,866 --> 00:19:11,001
Makes me wonder why you're
putting three-pointers up

375
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:12,470
every time
you come down the court.

376
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:15,039
Oh, that's 'cause I got
a candy-stroke, Coach.

377
00:19:15,106 --> 00:19:16,273
Ask Coach Dan.

378
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,042
I made the most threes
on the team last year.

379
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:20,810
Coach Dan, how many threes
did Marcus make last year?

380
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:22,645
Um, Marcus...

381
00:19:23,514 --> 00:19:24,548
made 34.

382
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:25,748
Outta how many attempts?

383
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:28,152
Out of 130.

384
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:29,686
What's that
a percentage of?

385
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:31,455
For a percentage of 26.

386
00:19:31,522 --> 00:19:32,590
Damn!

387
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,592
26%, Marcus.

388
00:19:34,657 --> 00:19:35,859
You wanna know why
they're leaving you open?

389
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,228
It's 'cause they don't think

390
00:19:37,294 --> 00:19:38,728
you could hit the ocean
from the beach.

391
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:40,097
Oh, shit.

392
00:19:40,164 --> 00:19:42,133
Yo, he just spit facts
at your ass, bro.

393
00:19:42,199 --> 00:19:43,567
Man, shut up.

394
00:19:43,633 --> 00:19:45,236
Look it, come on, man.
Don't get all butt-hurt

395
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:46,803
just 'cause he droppin'
some knowledge on you.

396
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,472
You wanna see butt-hurt?
Keep talking shit,

397
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:49,939
- watch me beat your fat ass.
- Shut the fuck up, yo.

398
00:19:50,007 --> 00:19:51,475
- You ain't gonna do shit.
- Hey.

399
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:53,210
I don't need any help.

400
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,282
Who is second in threes
on the team?

401
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:01,751
Number two would be
Kenny with 25.

402
00:20:01,818 --> 00:20:04,121
- Outta how many attempts?
- Sixty-one.

403
00:20:04,188 --> 00:20:05,156
Percentage of?

404
00:20:05,222 --> 00:20:07,291
Forty-one.

405
00:20:07,358 --> 00:20:08,725
Snap. You hear that?

406
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,027
Give me the rock,
let me go HAM on some bitches.

407
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:11,562
Yeah, more like
ham and cheese, man.

408
00:20:11,629 --> 00:20:13,297
Nah, actually, ham and cheese
is what your sister

409
00:20:13,364 --> 00:20:14,898
fries me up after I'm done
fiddling her bean.

410
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:16,167
Yo, show some respect.
Coach is here, man.

411
00:20:16,233 --> 00:20:17,834
Watch your mouth, man.

412
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:18,902
- Kenny, get in line.
- A'ight.

413
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:20,471
All right, run it back.

414
00:20:20,538 --> 00:20:21,938
Marcus, this time your feet
don't leave the paint.

415
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:23,174
- Brandon.
- All right. Let's go.

416
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,441
- Come on.
- Let's go, y'all.

417
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:26,410
You're the point guard, right?

418
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:27,911
Put 'em in a motion offense.

419
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,184
- Chubbs.
- Call it out, Brandon.

420
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,052
Don't just wave your hand
in the air.

421
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:36,520
Doesn't talk much, does he?

422
00:20:36,587 --> 00:20:38,788
I have been coaching
that kid for three years

423
00:20:38,855 --> 00:20:40,090
and I can count on one hand

424
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,559
how many times
our conversations

425
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,594
have gone past,
"Yes, Coach" and "No, Coach."

426
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:46,297
- Good shot, baby.
- And that's money!

427
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:48,032
Here you go.

428
00:20:48,098 --> 00:20:52,869
Keys, game balls, and then
I put together a flash drive

429
00:20:52,936 --> 00:20:54,638
just in case
you want to get familiar

430
00:20:54,704 --> 00:20:56,006
with the sets
we've been running.

431
00:20:56,073 --> 00:20:58,409
I'm also gonna give you
my phone number

432
00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:00,678
if you have any questions.

433
00:21:00,743 --> 00:21:02,179
Okay.

434
00:21:02,246 --> 00:21:03,746
Hey, why didn't you
take the job?

435
00:21:03,813 --> 00:21:05,149
- Huh?
- Would've made sense.

436
00:21:05,216 --> 00:21:07,817
The assistant coach,
step in, take the job.

437
00:21:08,751 --> 00:21:11,055
My mom has MS, so...

438
00:21:11,121 --> 00:21:12,789
My sister takes care of her
during the day,

439
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,491
but she's got
three kids of her own.

440
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:16,627
So I take nights.

441
00:21:16,694 --> 00:21:18,128
Sure.

442
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:19,430
Then with practices,
and then you have scouting...

443
00:21:19,496 --> 00:21:21,031
Yeah, no. Of course.
It makes sense.

444
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:22,199
There just aren't enough hours
in the day.

445
00:21:22,266 --> 00:21:23,500
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

446
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:24,834
No, no, no. It's cool.

447
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:26,803
We all have our own cross
to bear, right?

448
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:29,839
Um... So you should be good.

449
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:31,442
Great.
Thank you very much.

450
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,509
No problem.

451
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:36,813
- Oh, Coach.
- Yep?

452
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,915
What's the dress code like
these days?

453
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:41,385
Oh. Coat and tie
for the head coach.

454
00:21:41,452 --> 00:21:43,187
- Great. Thanks.
- Sure. No problem.

455
00:22:57,328 --> 00:22:59,862
Yeah!

456
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:01,765
Right here,
right here. Yeah!

457
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:03,033
Here we go!

458
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:05,469
Yeah!

459
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,471
Take the shot.

460
00:23:08,539 --> 00:23:10,574
That's you, Marcus.

461
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:12,543
Hey, Jack. Nice to see you
in the gym again.

462
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:13,610
Thanks.

463
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:16,246
That's you.

464
00:23:16,313 --> 00:23:18,482
Jack, this is
Father Mark Whelan.

465
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:20,050
He is our team chaplain.

466
00:23:20,117 --> 00:23:21,418
Pleasure to meet you, Jack.

467
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:22,486
You too.

468
00:23:22,553 --> 00:23:23,787
Any first game jitters?

469
00:23:23,853 --> 00:23:25,389
Fuck. I'm nervous as shit.

470
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:27,257
Yeah.

471
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,959
- What's this?
- Oh.

472
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:31,894
They do it before every game.
Gets them psyched up, I guess.

473
00:23:31,962 --> 00:23:33,364
Let's go!

474
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:34,765
All right, let's go.
Bring it in.

475
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:39,436
- Ready?
- No.

476
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:40,838
Let's go.

477
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:43,640
All right, guys.
Let's see what we're made of.

478
00:23:47,778 --> 00:23:49,912
And the big burly inmate
says, "Don't worry about it.

479
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,215
Everything's gonna be fine.

480
00:23:51,281 --> 00:23:52,349
I just want to play
a little game."

481
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,517
He goes, "Okay."

482
00:23:53,584 --> 00:23:55,285
And he says,
"In this game, you can pick

483
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:57,721
whether or not you want to be
the husband or the wife."

484
00:23:57,788 --> 00:23:59,456
And he says, "All right."
"Well?"

485
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:00,991
"Well, guess I'll be
the husband."

486
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:02,393
He goes, "Okay.

487
00:24:02,459 --> 00:24:04,061
Come on over here
and suck your wife's dick."

488
00:24:04,128 --> 00:24:06,096
That's a good one.

489
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:07,897
"Suck your wife's dick."
I fucking love that.

490
00:24:07,965 --> 00:24:09,233
Hey, Doc.

491
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:11,468
Hey.
How'd opening night go, ace?

492
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,936
Yeah, our boy got sent
to the woodshed.

493
00:24:14,004 --> 00:24:17,541
Hey, get Doc a drink, will ya?
And hit me with another one.

494
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:18,809
Doc, did I ever tell you

495
00:24:18,876 --> 00:24:20,444
the one about
the nerdy accountant

496
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:22,146
who does 15 years
for embezzlement?

497
00:24:22,212 --> 00:24:25,682
- Don't worry about me.
- I'm not. I know.

498
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:28,018
Just let me do... do my thing.

499
00:24:28,085 --> 00:24:29,119
Do your thing.

500
00:24:29,186 --> 00:24:30,920
All right. I appreciate it.

501
00:24:30,988 --> 00:24:33,490
- Okay.
- I'm just gonna...

502
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:36,260
- All right. Good night, Doc.
- Good night.

503
00:25:34,218 --> 00:25:35,819
Get your man!
Get your man!

504
00:25:35,886 --> 00:25:37,254
Come on!

505
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:38,989
Watch him.

506
00:25:55,806 --> 00:25:57,875
<i>Jackie! It's Miguel again.</i>

507
00:25:57,941 --> 00:25:59,510
<i>Just checking in to see</i>

508
00:25:59,576 --> 00:26:01,478
<i>if you got my call
about David's birthday party.</i>

509
00:26:01,545 --> 00:26:03,914
<i>Give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

510
00:26:03,982 --> 00:26:06,683
<i>Hey, it's me.
I know it's late notice,</i>

511
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,320
<i>but I'm gonna be down by you
for a client visit tomorrow</i>

512
00:26:10,387 --> 00:26:13,123
<i>and wanted to see if you
wanted to meet for lunch.</i>

513
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,626
<i>Anyway, call me
when you get this.</i>

514
00:26:28,973 --> 00:26:31,174
- Hi.
- Hey.

515
00:26:31,241 --> 00:26:33,343
Sorry I'm late.

516
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:36,146
Damn bus broke down on
the 710. It was a nightmare.

517
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:37,614
I just got here.

518
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,182
Okay.

519
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:40,817
You look good.

520
00:26:40,884 --> 00:26:42,920
Thanks. You too.

521
00:26:42,987 --> 00:26:44,788
How's the new job working out?

522
00:26:46,557 --> 00:26:49,027
It's insurance. It's boring,
but it pays the bills.

523
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:50,260
Good.

524
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:53,130
Heard you're
coaching basketball.

525
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:54,431
Beth tell you that?

526
00:26:54,498 --> 00:26:55,499
Yeah.

527
00:26:57,434 --> 00:26:58,936
So, you having fun?

528
00:26:59,003 --> 00:27:00,337
Yeah.

529
00:27:00,404 --> 00:27:02,105
I'd be having more fun
if we won a game...

530
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:05,509
...but keeps me occupied.

531
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:07,778
Keeps my mind
off other things.

532
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,050
Good. I was worried about you.

533
00:27:12,115 --> 00:27:14,117
What were you worried
about me for?

534
00:27:16,453 --> 00:27:19,289
You weren't
moving on with your life.

535
00:27:19,356 --> 00:27:22,392
You were seeing the world
in some dark ways.

536
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,129
Why? Are you?

537
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:28,231
Seeing the world in dark ways?

538
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:30,233
Moving on with your life.

539
00:27:39,142 --> 00:27:40,344
Uh-oh.

540
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:49,653
What's his name?

541
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,159
Nick.

542
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:01,832
How'd you guys meet?

543
00:28:02,866 --> 00:28:04,601
Through mutual friends.

544
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:09,506
How long has it been
going on for?

545
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:11,842
Few months.

546
00:28:13,477 --> 00:28:16,847
Few months? What, like,
six months? Eight months?

547
00:28:16,913 --> 00:28:18,649
Okay. All right. Come on.

548
00:28:18,715 --> 00:28:20,550
You know
what we want for lunch?

549
00:28:22,086 --> 00:28:23,820
Um...

550
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:26,156
Just give us a second,
actually. Thank you.

551
00:28:26,223 --> 00:28:27,491
Sure.

552
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:40,470
I wanted to tell you myself

553
00:28:40,537 --> 00:28:42,439
before you found out
through one of our friends.

554
00:28:51,049 --> 00:28:52,849
Say something, Jack.

555
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:57,155
What do you want me to say?

556
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,488
- "Congratulations"?
- No.

557
00:28:58,555 --> 00:28:59,523
Completely fucking blindsided
by this.

558
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:01,025
Not "congratulations."

559
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:04,594
Blindsided? We've been
separated for over a year.

560
00:29:15,872 --> 00:29:18,475
Will I see you
at the birthday party?

561
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,311
What?

562
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,814
Miguel and Sofia.

563
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,283
They're having
a birthday party for David.

564
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:28,852
Said he called you
a few times.

565
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:35,826
Let me know
if you want to go together.

566
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,668
Bye.

567
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:14,865
Jackie hits
his second free throw

568
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:17,001
and he just holds his hand
like this in the air

569
00:30:17,068 --> 00:30:18,602
for like 30 seconds.

570
00:30:18,668 --> 00:30:20,704
Purcell says,
"Jackie, you keep holding

571
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:22,906
your hand like that and
Eric's gonna ask you out."

572
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:26,843
Fifty-five points, man.

573
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,478
- To the legend.
- Yeah.

574
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:29,946
You gotta dim the lights
for the man.

575
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:31,715
- To the legend.
- To the legend.

576
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,688
Get the fuck outta here.

577
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,390
Why the fuck
do I need a sausage?

578
00:30:40,457 --> 00:30:43,261
He was like, "It's a PK.
It's a Polish kielbasa."

579
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:47,631
Ah. Yeah.

580
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:49,933
Fellas. Evening, boys.

581
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,436
We're talking
old times here.

582
00:30:53,503 --> 00:30:55,039
I know
what you're talking,

583
00:30:55,106 --> 00:30:56,640
and I'm telling you it's time
for him to get going.

584
00:30:56,706 --> 00:30:59,243
Come on, let's go now.
Come on. Let's go.

585
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:00,811
- I'm up.
- No, you're not.

586
00:31:00,877 --> 00:31:03,147
Now you are!

587
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:05,916
I'm up.

588
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:08,152
Whoa!

589
00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:10,453
- Shit.
- There you go. That's it.

590
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,621
Where are you
taking my friend?

591
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:13,090
Where are you
taking my friend?

592
00:31:26,369 --> 00:31:29,873
Okay, okay.
Uh, where's Kenny?

593
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,443
Kenny is the only one missing.
Kenny and Coach.

594
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,612
I just want you to know
that I respect you, a'ight?

595
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,014
- And I love you.
- Hmm.

596
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:38,648
Every time that ball
goes through the hoop,

597
00:31:38,715 --> 00:31:39,951
I'm gonna be
thinking about you.

598
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:41,351
- Kenny.
- Okay? And that goes through

599
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:42,519
- the hoop a lot.
- Kenny, let's go!

600
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:43,955
- The bus is waiting.
- Okay.

601
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:45,022
Hey, what up, Coach?

602
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,192
- Bye.
- Uh... Yeah.

603
00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:49,392
- You'll text me?
- Yeah, I'll text you after.

604
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:50,393
- Okay. Cool.
- Okay.

605
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,494
Hey, what's going on, man?

606
00:31:51,561 --> 00:31:52,863
Good luck!

607
00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:54,031
Oh, thanks.

608
00:31:54,098 --> 00:31:55,132
You better watch out.

609
00:31:55,199 --> 00:31:56,633
Priests catch you doing that

610
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,202
and you're gonna be spending
your weekends here.

611
00:31:58,269 --> 00:32:00,837
Nah, but it makes
my game better though, Coach.

612
00:32:00,904 --> 00:32:04,141
<i>Memorial!</i>

613
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:07,844
Memorial! Memorial!

614
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:11,381
Memorial!

615
00:32:11,448 --> 00:32:14,185
Memorial!

616
00:32:14,252 --> 00:32:16,087
Memorial!

617
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:18,755
Memorial!

618
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:22,126
Memorial!

619
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:24,061
Memorial!

620
00:32:24,128 --> 00:32:25,495
Let's go.

621
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:27,631
Hold on, hold on.

622
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:29,300
I want to talk to you.

623
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:32,136
These scrubs ain't worthy of
being on the same court as us.

624
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:49,886
- Hey, Coach.
- Hey, Coach.

625
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:51,255
How are ya?

626
00:32:51,322 --> 00:32:53,057
Good, good. I heard you got
a new general in charge.

627
00:32:53,124 --> 00:32:54,658
Yeah. Jack Cunningham.

628
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,360
Yeah. I'm surprised you could
keep him out of the bar

629
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:57,861
long enough to hold practice.

630
00:33:05,602 --> 00:33:06,937
Coach Lombardo.

631
00:33:07,004 --> 00:33:08,105
Jack Cunningham.

632
00:33:08,172 --> 00:33:09,974
He says that
like I don't know who he is.

633
00:33:10,041 --> 00:33:11,574
He's the best
high school basketball player

634
00:33:11,641 --> 00:33:13,177
I've ever seen.

635
00:33:13,244 --> 00:33:15,812
Listen, I was front row when
he hung 47 against Trinity

636
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:17,514
at the Catholic League semis.

637
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,583
Got quite a team there, Coach.
21's a hell of a ball player.

638
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,987
Yeah. So, how ya liking
coaching so far?

639
00:33:23,054 --> 00:33:24,989
Great. Just getting
used to the players.

640
00:33:25,056 --> 00:33:26,656
What players?

641
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:28,792
Ah, I'm just breaking
your stones, Jack.

642
00:33:29,893 --> 00:33:31,795
- Good luck.
- You can have the luck.

643
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:33,496
I'll take the thoroughbreds.

644
00:33:34,831 --> 00:33:36,100
What an asshole this guy is.

645
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:37,667
Yeah, big time.

646
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:49,846
Let's go. Bring it in.

647
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:51,048
Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

648
00:33:51,115 --> 00:33:52,183
Holy shit.

649
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:53,616
Here we go,
here we go, here we go.

650
00:33:53,683 --> 00:33:55,987
Chubbs. Hey!

651
00:33:56,053 --> 00:33:58,222
No more dancing.

652
00:33:58,289 --> 00:33:59,357
Coach, are you serious?

653
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:01,392
Yeah. I'm serious.

654
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:02,726
We're one in nine.

655
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:03,793
You're out there
jumping around

656
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,928
like you hit the Powerball.

657
00:34:04,996 --> 00:34:06,696
You're embarrassing yourself.

658
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:08,232
Win a few games, we can
talk about bringing it back.

659
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:10,567
But for now,
that act's retired. Got it?

660
00:34:10,633 --> 00:34:11,969
Yeah.

661
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,875
- One, two, three.
- Memorial!

662
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:31,055
Hey. Help, help.

663
00:34:32,423 --> 00:34:34,258
Let's go!

664
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,162
Motion, motion.

665
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:39,629
Let's go!
Bring him through.

666
00:34:39,696 --> 00:34:41,198
Hey, hey.

667
00:34:41,265 --> 00:34:42,632
Back up, back up.

668
00:34:48,105 --> 00:34:49,106
Oh, yeah!

669
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:52,143
Show hands.
Let's go, guys.

670
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:54,211
You guys gotta move.

671
00:34:54,278 --> 00:34:55,513
Oh, yeah!

672
00:34:55,578 --> 00:34:57,348
Let's go.
Lock him up. Lock him up.

673
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:01,551
- Fuck.
- Come on.

674
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:05,322
Time-out!

675
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:06,556
Get over here.
All right. Listen up.

676
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:10,660
Come on. Fuck.

677
00:35:10,727 --> 00:35:12,695
Get back. Get back!

678
00:35:24,208 --> 00:35:28,212
Defense, defense, defense!

679
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:29,612
Back screen,
back screen.

680
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,283
You guys gotta move!
Set picks!

681
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:33,350
Then squeeze!

682
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:37,587
Go.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

683
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:41,025
Shoot!

684
00:35:41,092 --> 00:35:42,126
Watch the clock!

685
00:35:42,193 --> 00:35:47,098
Five, four,
three, two, one!

686
00:35:50,501 --> 00:35:51,569
Time-out!

687
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,172
- Full time-out.
- Let's go. Bring it in.

688
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:56,240
Come on. Let's go.

689
00:35:56,307 --> 00:35:57,441
Nobody sits down.

690
00:35:57,508 --> 00:35:59,443
Stand up. Stand up.

691
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,810
I thought I said
to force him left.

692
00:36:00,877 --> 00:36:02,346
- Coach, I'm trying.
- Try harder.

693
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:04,515
What did I say about
fading off your man?

694
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:05,983
Why's shit always my fault?

695
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,784
Freeze, sub in for Marcus.

696
00:36:07,851 --> 00:36:09,120
- You taking me out?
- That's right.

697
00:36:09,186 --> 00:36:10,653
Sit the fuck down.

698
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,490
This is some bullshit, man.

699
00:36:12,556 --> 00:36:14,125
Listen to me.

700
00:36:14,191 --> 00:36:15,859
I want every one of you to
reach in your shorts right now

701
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,595
and tell me
if you find a pair.

702
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,862
'Cause right now,
you're playing like

703
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,431
a bunch of fucking pussies.

704
00:36:20,498 --> 00:36:21,831
And that's the truth.

705
00:36:21,898 --> 00:36:23,300
Next time 32 goes over
your back like that,

706
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:25,136
put a fucking elbow
in his stomach.

707
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:26,504
Yes, Coach.

708
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,038
And if Childress tries to
put you on a poster like that,

709
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,440
you hit him so fucking hard

710
00:36:29,507 --> 00:36:30,640
he never comes down the lane
like that again.

711
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:31,708
I got you.

712
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,410
Have a little fucking pride.

713
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:35,279
I don't give a shit if we lose
every fucking game this year.

714
00:36:35,346 --> 00:36:38,482
I will not coach a team
that has been out-toughed.

715
00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:39,749
All right? Let's go!

716
00:36:39,816 --> 00:36:41,051
Fuck yeah, man.
Here we go.

717
00:36:41,118 --> 00:36:42,586
"Team" on three.
One, two, three.

718
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:43,853
Team!

719
00:36:49,726 --> 00:36:51,061
I'm in for 50.

720
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:01,539
Come on.
Switch up, switch up!

721
00:37:01,605 --> 00:37:02,805
Chubbs.

722
00:37:03,574 --> 00:37:04,975
Let's go, 3.

723
00:37:06,776 --> 00:37:08,012
Come on!

724
00:37:14,218 --> 00:37:16,153
Hey, hey, hey. Chill.

725
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,088
Get back here.
Get back here.

726
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,025
Get the fuck off, bro.
Hey, get the fuck off, bro.

727
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:22,825
Bro,
I'll beat your ass.

728
00:37:22,892 --> 00:37:24,928
I'll fuck you up, bitch.

729
00:37:28,632 --> 00:37:30,134
That is a flagrant foul.

730
00:37:30,201 --> 00:37:31,868
Hey,
that's enough. That's enough.

731
00:37:31,935 --> 00:37:32,970
I didn't do fucking anything,
man. Watch yourself.

732
00:37:33,037 --> 00:37:34,438
- Get back there.
- Get over there!

733
00:37:34,505 --> 00:37:37,107
What the hell is that?
That guy should be out.

734
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:39,076
Control your players,
Cunningham.

735
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:40,710
That is bullshit, man.

736
00:37:40,777 --> 00:37:43,180
What the hell? Come on!

737
00:37:45,449 --> 00:37:47,717
Right. All right.

738
00:37:47,784 --> 00:37:49,752
- I'm feeling a comeback.
- Come on.

739
00:38:08,706 --> 00:38:10,307
- Jack?
- Yeah.

740
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:12,977
Uh...

741
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:14,844
Just wanted to have
a little chat with you

742
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:17,514
about something
that was on my mind.

743
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:21,218
Um, I don't know if you recall
from your days as a student,

744
00:38:21,285 --> 00:38:25,089
but we have
a code of conduct at Hayes.

745
00:38:25,155 --> 00:38:28,959
Part of that code includes the
use of appropriate language.

746
00:38:29,026 --> 00:38:31,195
I understand you're trying to
motivate the team,

747
00:38:31,262 --> 00:38:34,298
I just wonder if maybe
there's a different approach.

748
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:37,568
So, you would, uh...

749
00:38:37,635 --> 00:38:40,271
You would like me to be
a little more, uh...

750
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:43,641
Christlike on the bench?

751
00:38:43,707 --> 00:38:45,242
I... I'd like you
to keep in mind

752
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:48,145
that our mission at Hayes
isn't to win basketball games.

753
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:51,248
It's to develop
men of integrity and faith.

754
00:38:51,315 --> 00:38:54,817
Just give it some thought
for me. Will you do that?

755
00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:56,786
- Yes, I will.
- Thank you.

756
00:38:56,853 --> 00:39:00,324
Father, let me
ask you something.

757
00:39:00,391 --> 00:39:03,527
With all the terrible stuff
going on in the world,

758
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:04,927
you think who's ever up there

759
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:06,730
really gives a shit
what I say to these kids?

760
00:39:08,065 --> 00:39:10,000
As Christians,
we are called by God

761
00:39:10,067 --> 00:39:12,169
to integrate our faith
into our daily lives.

762
00:39:12,236 --> 00:39:14,338
So, yes, Jack. I do think
he really gives a shit

763
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:18,008
about the example you set
for these young men.

764
00:39:18,075 --> 00:39:21,078
Don't underestimate the impact
you can have on them.

765
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:35,326
All right. I'll take
a look at the game tape.

766
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:37,761
We can talk about if we
wanna use that 1-3-1 zone.

767
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:38,895
Got it. Sounds good.

768
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:40,464
Have a good night.

769
00:39:47,237 --> 00:39:49,740
- Hey, Jack.
- Yeah?

770
00:39:49,807 --> 00:39:52,976
I noticed some empty beer cans
in the office earlier.

771
00:39:54,244 --> 00:39:55,312
Do you...

772
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:57,081
You've been sneaking
around the office?

773
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:59,149
Well, Garcia lost a contact
lens, so the solution...

774
00:39:59,216 --> 00:40:01,385
A friend came by.
He wanted to look at some...

775
00:40:01,452 --> 00:40:03,987
And we were hanging out.

776
00:40:04,054 --> 00:40:05,289
I mean, you're not
gonna break my balls

777
00:40:05,356 --> 00:40:07,257
about a couple of beer cans,
are ya?

778
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,660
Just don't let it
happen again, okay?

779
00:40:09,727 --> 00:40:11,195
Yeah, no problem.

780
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,423
Hey, hey, Jackie!

781
00:40:41,225 --> 00:40:43,227
I'll set you up inside,
all right?

782
00:41:52,996 --> 00:41:56,099
All right. We're gonna
change things up a little bit.

783
00:41:56,166 --> 00:41:57,334
We're the smallest team
in the league

784
00:41:57,401 --> 00:41:59,036
and our half-court
offense sucks.

785
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,538
We're gonna score some points
with defense. We gotta press.

786
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:05,142
1-2-1-1.
Call it the diamond press.

787
00:42:05,209 --> 00:42:06,977
Requires two things,

788
00:42:07,044 --> 00:42:08,745
toughness and quickness.

789
00:42:08,812 --> 00:42:11,548
We're gonna be picking up
after every dead ball.

790
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:13,650
Full court, all game.

791
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:17,721
Keep your clothes on, Marcus.

792
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:19,056
Talking to me?

793
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:20,457
Come late to the game,
you don't play.

794
00:42:20,524 --> 00:42:22,326
We'll talk about it
at practice tomorrow.

795
00:42:22,392 --> 00:42:24,561
What are you talking about?
I'm, like, four minutes late.

796
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,231
You know what?
Forget about tomorrow.

797
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:28,499
Go home. You're off the team.

798
00:42:29,968 --> 00:42:32,870
Coach Dan, what the hell is
his problem? I'm barely late.

799
00:42:32,936 --> 00:42:35,172
You heard Coach, Marcus.
Go home.

800
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:37,875
Are you
fucking serious right now?

801
00:42:37,941 --> 00:42:39,743
I'm barely fucking late.

802
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:45,616
Y'all fucking stupid, man.
This dumb-ass team.

803
00:42:49,253 --> 00:42:50,721
Freeze,
you're starting tonight.

804
00:42:50,787 --> 00:42:53,156
Means you're gonna be guarding
the inbounder, okay?

805
00:42:53,223 --> 00:42:54,525
Got it, Coach.

806
00:42:58,929 --> 00:43:00,130
Ah, this should be fun.

807
00:43:00,197 --> 00:43:01,632
- Evening, Sal.
- What's up, Jackie?

808
00:43:01,698 --> 00:43:03,233
Give us some friendly whistles
tonight, will you?

809
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,501
Yeah, right.
That's funny.

810
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:05,836
They ain't paying me enough
for that.

811
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:08,305
Let's go. Here we go.

812
00:43:09,273 --> 00:43:10,774
Freeze, Freeze, Freeze!

813
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:12,242
- Hands up. Hands up!
- Freeze, help! Help out.

814
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:13,610
Freeze, help!

815
00:43:14,878 --> 00:43:16,580
That's it!

816
00:43:16,647 --> 00:43:19,116
- What? Come on, ref.
- What's the call, ref?

817
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:21,184
White 23 blocked.
Two shots.

818
00:43:21,251 --> 00:43:23,420
Oh, bullshit!

819
00:43:23,487 --> 00:43:25,789
Come on! That's a fucking
horseshit call, Sal.

820
00:43:25,856 --> 00:43:27,090
Jack, settle down

821
00:43:27,157 --> 00:43:28,392
- or it's gonna cost you.
- It's bullshit.

822
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:29,726
And you know
it's fucking horseshit.

823
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:31,628
That's why I didn't make it.
All right?

824
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:33,764
- Tell him to go fuck himself.
- I'll tell him after the game.

825
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,232
Bullshit!

826
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:37,200
God damn it!

827
00:43:37,267 --> 00:43:38,669
Box out. Box out.

828
00:43:38,735 --> 00:43:39,670
Let's go, y'all.

829
00:43:39,736 --> 00:43:42,306
Box out.

830
00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:47,578
Come on, fellas.
Hey, let's box this out.

831
00:43:47,644 --> 00:43:49,246
Rebound!

832
00:43:49,313 --> 00:43:50,747
Come on, Hayes!

833
00:43:50,814 --> 00:43:52,349
Time-out! Time-out!

834
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:54,251
Sal, time-out. God damn it.

835
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:55,752
Time-out.

836
00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:58,689
Full time-out here.
Full time-out here.

837
00:43:58,755 --> 00:44:00,190
God damn, man.

838
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:04,928
Bring it in. Sit down.

839
00:44:04,996 --> 00:44:06,330
All right.
Come on, guys. Let's go.

840
00:44:06,396 --> 00:44:07,798
Let's win this fucking game.

841
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:10,334
We've got 15 seconds left.
We're gonna go on 8.

842
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,402
Gives us time
for a rebound or a tip-in.

843
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:15,238
<i>Brandon, 20's gonna pick
you up full court. All right?</i>

844
00:44:15,305 --> 00:44:16,673
<i>Freeze, you're gonna come up</i>

845
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,308
<i>and set a ball screen
for Brandon.</i>

846
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,676
<i>Brandon, you roll around
to the right.</i>

847
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,445
Garcia, come up,
set a back screen for Kenny.

848
00:44:21,511 --> 00:44:23,280
Kenny, come out to the wing
for the three.

849
00:44:23,347 --> 00:44:24,781
<i>That way we got three options.</i>

850
00:44:24,848 --> 00:44:27,217
<i>Brandon attacking right
will look for Freeze</i>

851
00:44:27,284 --> 00:44:28,452
<i>coming off the screen.</i>

852
00:44:28,518 --> 00:44:29,954
Watch the clock!
Watch the clock!

853
00:44:30,021 --> 00:44:31,655
If neither of those
are there, go to Kenny

854
00:44:31,722 --> 00:44:33,490
for the three in the corner.
You got this, okay?

855
00:44:33,557 --> 00:44:34,625
No, don't just nod. I wanna
hear your voice. Yes or no?

856
00:44:34,691 --> 00:44:36,159
Yes, Coach.

857
00:44:36,226 --> 00:44:37,594
Set it, set it, set it!

858
00:44:38,895 --> 00:44:40,297
That's you, B!

859
00:44:40,364 --> 00:44:41,698
Go, Brandon!

860
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:43,634
Watch the clock!
Watch the clock!

861
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,208
We won!

862
00:45:08,825 --> 00:45:10,360
Brandon, you need a ride?

863
00:45:11,062 --> 00:45:12,229
No, I'm good, Coach.

864
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:14,231
Where do you live?

865
00:45:14,297 --> 00:45:15,799
Uh, Los Codona Ave.

866
00:45:15,866 --> 00:45:17,367
Come on, get in the car.

867
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:25,809
You walk home alone
every night?

868
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:29,212
Mmm-hmm.

869
00:45:29,279 --> 00:45:30,647
Where's Mom or Dad?

870
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:32,949
My mom died three years ago

871
00:45:33,017 --> 00:45:36,386
and my dad's at home
with my little brothers.

872
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:38,555
That's why he didn't come
to any of the games?

873
00:45:39,556 --> 00:45:41,092
Yeah.

874
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:42,826
You played
a hell of a game tonight.

875
00:45:44,162 --> 00:45:45,662
Next time, shoot the ball.

876
00:45:48,265 --> 00:45:49,433
On the last play?

877
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:51,668
That's your shot, not Kenny's.

878
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:54,771
Yeah, the defense
collapsed on me,

879
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:56,606
so Kenny was open
in the corner.

880
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:58,508
Right.

881
00:45:58,575 --> 00:46:00,911
So that was a smart play.

882
00:46:00,978 --> 00:46:04,548
Sometimes a smart play
is not the right play.

883
00:46:04,614 --> 00:46:06,917
You're the best player
on the team.

884
00:46:06,984 --> 00:46:08,418
The game's on the line,

885
00:46:08,485 --> 00:46:10,520
100 times out of 100
I want you taking that shot.

886
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:14,291
Why is that so hard
for you to believe?

887
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:16,259
What?

888
00:46:16,326 --> 00:46:17,828
That you're the best player
on the team.

889
00:46:17,894 --> 00:46:21,698
You understand this game
in a way these guys don't.

890
00:46:21,765 --> 00:46:23,366
I saw you get frustrated
at Chubbs

891
00:46:23,433 --> 00:46:25,435
when he didn't go backdoor
on the ball reverse.

892
00:46:25,502 --> 00:46:28,438
Or Freeze, when he didn't
duck under on the Atlanta set.

893
00:46:30,141 --> 00:46:32,843
Why didn't you call him out
for not making the right play?

894
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:38,015
Uh, it's not really my thing
to call someone out.

895
00:46:38,082 --> 00:46:40,952
I'm not, like, the
team captain or nothing, so...

896
00:46:41,018 --> 00:46:42,619
So, if I make you the captain,

897
00:46:42,686 --> 00:46:44,588
are you gonna chew Chubbs out
when he doesn't go backdoor?

898
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,460
Yes or no?

899
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:56,968
I'm just up here
on the left.

900
00:47:04,976 --> 00:47:06,343
Night, Coach.

901
00:47:15,452 --> 00:47:16,988
Hey, son.

902
00:47:17,054 --> 00:47:18,122
Who that?

903
00:47:18,189 --> 00:47:19,556
That's my new coach.

904
00:47:19,623 --> 00:47:20,992
All right.
Go on, get with that homework.

905
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:22,292
Yes, sir.

906
00:47:37,507 --> 00:47:38,642
Atlanta high, Atlanta high.

907
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:40,710
Stop, stop, stop. Reset.

908
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:43,114
- What set are we in, Brandon?
- Atlanta high.

909
00:47:43,181 --> 00:47:44,714
- Did you call it out?
- Yeah.

910
00:47:44,781 --> 00:47:46,150
- Did you guys hear him?
- Nah.

911
00:47:46,217 --> 00:47:47,884
We're in an empty gym,
and nobody heard you.

912
00:47:47,952 --> 00:47:49,220
Do it again.

913
00:47:49,287 --> 00:47:50,754
Atlanta high. Atlanta high.

914
00:47:50,821 --> 00:47:52,957
Reset.

915
00:47:53,024 --> 00:47:55,293
Brandon,
I still can't hear you.

916
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:56,927
You're gonna be
our point guard,

917
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:58,895
people need to be able to hear
what you say on the floor.

918
00:47:58,963 --> 00:48:00,730
You hear how loud
I'm talking right now?

919
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,499
- Yeah.
- That's how loud

920
00:48:02,566 --> 00:48:03,867
- you need to be.
- All right.

921
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:05,303
You can do it, B.
Come on, Brandon.

922
00:48:05,368 --> 00:48:07,205
I can't hear you, Brandon.

923
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:08,471
Come on,
break that press.

924
00:48:08,538 --> 00:48:10,107
B, break that press.

925
00:48:10,174 --> 00:48:11,775
Call it out.

926
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:14,979
Brandon, I can't hear you.

927
00:48:15,046 --> 00:48:16,446
Yo, are you
fucking serious? Get off me!

928
00:48:16,513 --> 00:48:18,149
There's 3,000 people
at Memorial

929
00:48:18,216 --> 00:48:19,349
screaming their heads off,

930
00:48:19,416 --> 00:48:20,483
and I don't know
what set we're in!

931
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:21,986
Fuck you!

932
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:24,888
Can you hear me now?

933
00:48:26,224 --> 00:48:27,557
Can you?

934
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,995
Yeah,
I can hear you now.

935
00:48:55,152 --> 00:48:56,220
What's up, Coach?

936
00:48:56,287 --> 00:48:57,587
How'd you find my house?

937
00:48:57,654 --> 00:48:59,389
I looked you up on my phone.

938
00:49:00,024 --> 00:49:01,058
Oh.

939
00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:03,327
What do you want?

940
00:49:03,393 --> 00:49:07,664
Uh... So my momma, she works
till 7:00 every night.

941
00:49:07,731 --> 00:49:09,033
And she was like,
she doesn't want me

942
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:10,667
really being out on my own
after school.

943
00:49:10,734 --> 00:49:12,036
So she was wondering

944
00:49:12,103 --> 00:49:13,971
maybe if you'll let me back
on the team.

945
00:49:14,038 --> 00:49:17,141
I already told you, Marcus.
I don't want you on the team.

946
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,642
If it's about finding
something to do after school,

947
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:20,378
I'll talk to Coach Dan.

948
00:49:20,443 --> 00:49:21,912
We can set you up with study
hall or something like that.

949
00:49:22,612 --> 00:49:24,514
All right? Sorry.

950
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,608
I thought that was
a pretty fair offer, Marcus.

951
00:49:54,678 --> 00:49:57,381
My momma ain't
sent me here, Coach.

952
00:49:57,447 --> 00:49:59,783
I'm here
'cause I wanna play ball.

953
00:50:01,385 --> 00:50:03,620
I miss it.

954
00:50:03,687 --> 00:50:05,855
I don't fucking like
nothing else, Coach.

955
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:08,159
Don't swear.

956
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:10,261
There's a code of conduct
policy at the school.

957
00:50:10,328 --> 00:50:11,828
- You know that?
- My bad.

958
00:50:11,895 --> 00:50:15,199
There's a big section in there
about swearing.

959
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:19,469
I'm sorry. I won't swear.

960
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:31,514
Be at practice
tomorrow at 4:00.

961
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:33,516
- You serious?
- Don't be late.

962
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:34,918
Ah, fuck no...
I mean heck.

963
00:50:34,986 --> 00:50:37,587
I'm sorry. Heck no,
I'm not gonna be late.

964
00:50:37,654 --> 00:50:39,689
I'm sorry about cursing,
Coach.

965
00:50:45,862 --> 00:50:48,565
Let's go. Bring it in.

966
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:50,900
- Oh, my gosh.
- It wasn't me.

967
00:50:53,837 --> 00:50:56,107
A few things
before we get started.

968
00:50:56,173 --> 00:50:59,542
As you can see,
Marcus is rejoining the team.

969
00:51:00,444 --> 00:51:01,778
Judging by that reaction,

970
00:51:01,845 --> 00:51:02,946
I expect it'll be some time

971
00:51:03,014 --> 00:51:04,514
before he regains
your respect.

972
00:51:05,116 --> 00:51:07,084
Second thing is,

973
00:51:07,151 --> 00:51:08,585
Sam and I discussed...

974
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:11,255
we're gonna make a change
to the captain spot.

975
00:51:11,322 --> 00:51:13,190
Brandon, you're gonna be
our captain going forward.

976
00:51:15,459 --> 00:51:17,028
That's it. Get to work.

977
00:51:17,094 --> 00:51:18,762
All right, fellas.
Let's go. Let's work.

978
00:51:18,828 --> 00:51:20,164
Let's hustle up.
Let's do it.

979
00:51:20,231 --> 00:51:22,832
Good shit, B. I'll follow
your lead. Come on.

980
00:51:26,203 --> 00:51:27,670
Every time that ball
goes through the hoop,

981
00:51:27,737 --> 00:51:28,905
I'm gonna be thinking
about you.

982
00:51:28,973 --> 00:51:30,408
- You know that?
- Yeah.

983
00:51:30,474 --> 00:51:31,775
Yo, let's go.

984
00:51:31,841 --> 00:51:33,511
- Bro, what?
- Come on.

985
00:51:33,576 --> 00:51:35,146
A'ight. I'll see you after.
Okay?

986
00:51:35,212 --> 00:51:36,213
Bye, Kenny.

987
00:51:40,084 --> 00:51:43,387
All right, let's go.
Move.

988
00:51:43,454 --> 00:51:45,456
<i>What did we discover
last night at Baptist?</i>

989
00:51:45,523 --> 00:51:46,524
That defense
creates offense.

990
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:47,724
We have to maintain

991
00:51:47,791 --> 00:51:49,126
pressure for
all four quarters.

992
00:51:49,193 --> 00:51:50,760
- That's right.
- All right.

993
00:51:50,827 --> 00:51:52,296
Discovered that
we're a pressing team.

994
00:51:52,363 --> 00:51:53,897
We don't take any plays off,
we don't let 'em breathe.

995
00:51:53,964 --> 00:51:55,299
As soon as they get
over half-court, we trap.

996
00:51:55,366 --> 00:51:57,567
Even if the ball's
in the middle of the court?

997
00:51:57,634 --> 00:51:58,969
Anywhere and everywhere.

998
00:51:59,036 --> 00:52:00,271
You can't trap
if the ball's in the middle

999
00:52:00,337 --> 00:52:01,738
of the floor.
You need the sideline.

1000
00:52:01,805 --> 00:52:03,274
Who says?
We can do whatever we want.

1001
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,774
Get up!

1002
00:52:04,841 --> 00:52:06,177
There you go.
There you go. Stay with him!

1003
00:52:06,243 --> 00:52:07,877
Pressure, pressure.
Don't let him breathe.

1004
00:52:07,944 --> 00:52:09,413
- There you go.
- Trap, trap, trap!

1005
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,415
Bring it around. Stay on him.

1006
00:52:11,482 --> 00:52:13,783
No! Bullshit!

1007
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:16,120
That's a chickenshit
fucking call.

1008
00:52:16,187 --> 00:52:17,654
God damn it!

1009
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:21,825
- I'm working on it.
- Work harder.

1010
00:52:22,259 --> 00:52:23,793
Come on!

1011
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,767
If we're gonna keep
winning games,

1012
00:52:30,834 --> 00:52:32,869
we gotta make our lack of size
an advantage.

1013
00:52:32,936 --> 00:52:34,271
We gotta speed the game up.

1014
00:52:34,338 --> 00:52:36,073
We gotta play every possession
like it's a war.

1015
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,209
Oh, come on!
You've gotta be fucking blind!

1016
00:52:38,275 --> 00:52:39,843
That's a horseshit call!

1017
00:52:42,446 --> 00:52:44,115
We done yet, Coach?

1018
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:45,648
We're a pressing team.
It's not even the third quarter.

1019
00:52:45,715 --> 00:52:46,783
We're just getting warmed up.

1020
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:48,651
Motion, motion.

1021
00:52:50,087 --> 00:52:51,621
<i>What did we discover
last night at Downey?</i>

1022
00:52:51,688 --> 00:52:53,023
We gotta take charges.

1023
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:54,358
We gotta play
with chips on our shoulders.

1024
00:52:54,425 --> 00:52:55,792
Play with a chip
on your fucking shoulder.

1025
00:52:55,859 --> 00:52:57,228
Goddamn right.

1026
00:52:57,294 --> 00:52:59,896
Marcus. Come on,
you're going in for Chubbs.

1027
00:52:59,964 --> 00:53:01,731
Marcus, I want you
to cover the inbound, okay?

1028
00:53:01,798 --> 00:53:03,601
Big arms. Force him
to pass into the corner.

1029
00:53:03,666 --> 00:53:04,667
That's it!

1030
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:05,902
<i>The little things add up.</i>

1031
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,538
Let's do
all the little things right.

1032
00:53:07,605 --> 00:53:11,041
<i>Loose ball gets us two points.
Tip pass gets us to four.</i>

1033
00:53:11,108 --> 00:53:13,077
<i>Steal gets us another two.
Now we're at six.</i>

1034
00:53:13,144 --> 00:53:15,412
Turnover out of our press
gets us to eight.

1035
00:53:15,479 --> 00:53:17,214
All this shit adds up.

1036
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:20,750
<i>Every box-out, every hustle,
every loose ball, every trap.</i>

1037
00:53:20,817 --> 00:53:22,286
<i>Put all that shit together,</i>

1038
00:53:22,353 --> 00:53:23,753
all of a sudden we're pretty
fucking tough to beat.

1039
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,156
Hit that!

1040
00:53:30,027 --> 00:53:32,229
- That's how we do it.
- Got that candy-stroke.

1041
00:53:32,296 --> 00:53:33,998
What quarter
are we in, Coach?

1042
00:53:34,064 --> 00:53:35,832
The fourth quarter.

1043
00:53:35,899 --> 00:53:37,301
<i>The other team's gassed.</i>

1044
00:53:37,368 --> 00:53:39,203
<i>Let's see what we got left
in the tank.</i>

1045
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:43,574
<i>Hayes, let's go!
Bishop Hayes, let's go!</i>

1046
00:53:43,641 --> 00:53:45,609
<i>Hayes, let's go!</i>

1047
00:53:45,675 --> 00:53:47,677
<i>Bishop Hayes, let's go!</i>

1048
00:53:47,744 --> 00:53:49,113
Kenny.

1049
00:53:50,847 --> 00:53:53,951
Coach, why you gotta do me
like that, man?

1050
00:53:54,018 --> 00:53:56,187
Good luck tonight, Kenny.

1051
00:54:01,891 --> 00:54:03,394
<i>What quarter are we in,
Coach?</i>

1052
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,297
Holy shit, look at that.
We just went into overtime.

1053
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,207
What did we learn
about ourselves last night?

1054
00:54:16,273 --> 00:54:18,075
That we have to
respect the game.

1055
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:20,411
That's right.

1056
00:54:20,477 --> 00:54:22,079
Respect.

1057
00:54:25,915 --> 00:54:29,186
Yo, Coach,
how many more I got?

1058
00:54:29,253 --> 00:54:31,388
Well, Kenny,
it's not up to me.

1059
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:33,290
- Let's keep him moving.
- Come on.

1060
00:54:33,357 --> 00:54:35,792
Hey, y'all. How y'all
gonna do me like that?

1061
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:37,194
I loved each and every one
of you girls.

1062
00:54:37,261 --> 00:54:38,828
- Have fun.
- Bye, Kenny.

1063
00:54:38,895 --> 00:54:40,197
- Hayley, you know I...
- No, keep going.

1064
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:41,699
Girls,
you're all in my heart.

1065
00:54:41,764 --> 00:54:42,967
You each have
your own little section.

1066
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:44,201
Hurry up!

1067
00:54:44,268 --> 00:54:45,835
I'm going!

1068
00:54:46,936 --> 00:54:48,771
- Bye!
- Bye, Kenny.

1069
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:17,867
Hey.

1070
00:55:17,934 --> 00:55:19,136
Hey.

1071
00:55:21,305 --> 00:55:22,306
Ready?

1072
00:55:34,817 --> 00:55:36,754
- Hi.
- Angela!

1073
00:55:36,819 --> 00:55:39,657
- Hi.
- Oh, my goodness.

1074
00:55:39,723 --> 00:55:41,458
So, the doctors
are optimistic?

1075
00:55:42,393 --> 00:55:43,793
So far, so good.

1076
00:55:44,228 --> 00:55:45,396
Great.

1077
00:55:47,464 --> 00:55:48,699
They told us,

1078
00:55:48,766 --> 00:55:51,302
"Let him do all the things
any normal kid would do."

1079
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:54,605
But you know
what remission's like.

1080
00:55:54,672 --> 00:55:55,973
Yeah.

1081
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:57,608
Living life
waiting on pins and needles

1082
00:55:57,675 --> 00:55:59,677
for the other shoe to drop.

1083
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:02,246
Spoke to Ethan lately?

1084
00:56:02,313 --> 00:56:03,647
He called me
a couple of times.

1085
00:56:03,714 --> 00:56:05,115
I haven't gotten back to him.

1086
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:08,218
Andrew's not looking so good.

1087
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:11,121
And now they're, uh,
talking about hospice.

1088
00:56:13,457 --> 00:56:14,358
Jesus.

1089
00:56:14,425 --> 00:56:16,193
Can I use
a different bat, Dad?

1090
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,494
Pick any bat
you want, son.

1091
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:19,363
But first say hello
to Mr. Cunningham.

1092
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:21,565
- Hi, Mr. Cunningham.
- Hey, how you doing, pal?

1093
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:23,167
Michael's dad.

1094
00:56:23,933 --> 00:56:25,336
You remember Michael.

1095
00:56:25,402 --> 00:56:26,770
Remember,
we were in the hospital.

1096
00:56:26,836 --> 00:56:28,205
- It's all right.
- Halloween, we...

1097
00:56:28,272 --> 00:56:29,673
No, no, no. We put you two
in a wheelchair...

1098
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,508
and then we pushed you
all around the hospital

1099
00:56:31,575 --> 00:56:33,143
- collecting candy.
- Mmm-hmm.

1100
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:34,812
Doctor was gonna
kill you for that.

1101
00:56:34,877 --> 00:56:36,380
- Yeah.
- That was your idea.

1102
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:38,148
- Michael was Dracula.
- That's right. He was Dracula.

1103
00:56:38,215 --> 00:56:39,717
Who's ready to sing
<i>Happy Birthday?</i>

1104
00:56:39,783 --> 00:56:40,818
All right, buddy.
Let's do this.

1105
00:56:40,883 --> 00:56:42,586
Who wants cake? Whoo!

1106
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:45,055
- Cake, cake, cake.
- It's cake time.

1107
00:56:45,956 --> 00:56:47,424
Come on, son, let's go.

1108
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:51,295
Cake, cake, cake.

1109
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:03,640
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1110
00:57:03,707 --> 00:57:09,046
<i>♪ Happy birthday, dear David ♪</i>

1111
00:57:09,113 --> 00:57:13,584
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1112
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:43,013
Hi, Michael.

1113
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,082
Please, Lord,
look after my son.

1114
00:57:46,617 --> 00:57:48,318
Please let him be happy.

1115
00:58:15,145 --> 00:58:17,014
I miss you, pal.

1116
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:00,123
Thanks for coming
to the party.

1117
00:59:03,594 --> 00:59:05,128
I know
Miguel and Sofia invite us

1118
00:59:05,195 --> 00:59:06,763
'cause they don't want us
to feel

1119
00:59:07,764 --> 00:59:09,233
excluded,

1120
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,335
but I just end up feeling like

1121
00:59:12,603 --> 00:59:15,305
even more of an outcast.

1122
00:59:15,372 --> 00:59:18,609
It's like I just get angry
all over again.

1123
00:59:18,675 --> 00:59:22,145
Look around at all the boys,
and wish it was one of them,

1124
00:59:22,946 --> 00:59:24,481
not Michael.

1125
00:59:26,383 --> 00:59:28,719
Does that make me
an awful person?

1126
00:59:31,154 --> 00:59:33,290
I never stop being angry.

1127
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:44,434
I know you're suffering.

1128
00:59:46,637 --> 00:59:50,107
Yeah, I'm suffering.

1129
00:59:52,276 --> 00:59:53,777
And I miss my son.

1130
00:59:56,613 --> 00:59:59,483
And I don't believe
he's in a better place.

1131
01:00:01,118 --> 01:00:02,553
I believe
the best place for him

1132
01:00:02,619 --> 01:00:05,155
was right here
with you and me.

1133
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:09,526
Yeah.

1134
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,328
Home.

1135
01:00:12,129 --> 01:00:14,464
We're both suffering.

1136
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:16,667
I don't know, Ang, you seem
to be doing pretty good.

1137
01:00:17,568 --> 01:00:19,703
A new job,

1138
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:22,472
fucking some rich guy
while we're still married.

1139
01:00:33,985 --> 01:00:35,485
Sorry.

1140
01:01:02,846 --> 01:01:04,548
You could go
to the library.

1141
01:01:04,615 --> 01:01:06,516
They have a book club there
every Friday.

1142
01:01:06,583 --> 01:01:09,119
- The library? Really?
- Yep.

1143
01:01:09,186 --> 01:01:10,587
Would you go with me?

1144
01:01:10,654 --> 01:01:12,289
- Well...
- It's for senior women.

1145
01:01:12,356 --> 01:01:14,458
For heaven's sakes,
Kurt.

1146
01:01:14,524 --> 01:01:16,660
I don't have a problem
making friends.

1147
01:01:16,727 --> 01:01:19,262
I don't. But it's just
a whole new place.

1148
01:01:19,329 --> 01:01:21,231
I've only been there
a little while. Give me...

1149
01:01:21,298 --> 01:01:22,599
Well, it's called
a two-way street, though.

1150
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:26,004
- You gotta get out a little.
- Uh...

1151
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:29,306
You think maybe it's time for
a new shower curtain, Jack?

1152
01:01:29,373 --> 01:01:30,841
No, I hadn't thought about it.

1153
01:01:30,907 --> 01:01:33,777
Oh, well, you should,
'cause that thing smells.

1154
01:01:33,844 --> 01:01:34,878
Anybody want a drink?

1155
01:01:34,945 --> 01:01:36,346
- No. No.
- I'm good.

1156
01:01:36,413 --> 01:01:37,982
So, what does
the scout report look like

1157
01:01:38,049 --> 01:01:39,449
for the team today, Jack?

1158
01:01:39,516 --> 01:01:42,419
Uh, well, they're
struggling a little bit.

1159
01:01:42,486 --> 01:01:44,454
Trinity has lost six in a row.

1160
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:46,623
They have one good shooter,
TJ Edmonds,

1161
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,558
but Uncle Jack's team
should win.

1162
01:01:48,625 --> 01:01:50,260
And they kinda have to win.

1163
01:01:50,327 --> 01:01:52,195
'Cause if they don't
win tonight,

1164
01:01:52,262 --> 01:01:53,597
their next chance at getting

1165
01:01:53,664 --> 01:01:55,666
into the playoffs
is against Memorial.

1166
01:01:55,732 --> 01:01:58,402
And Memorial's the number one
ranked team in the state.

1167
01:01:58,468 --> 01:01:59,770
You should see him,
Jack.

1168
01:01:59,836 --> 01:02:01,238
Every morning,
the night after your game,

1169
01:02:01,304 --> 01:02:02,572
he wakes up early,
he goes downstairs,

1170
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:03,975
checks the stats
on the computer.

1171
01:02:04,042 --> 01:02:05,909
Maybe I should be the
assistant coach tonight.

1172
01:02:07,744 --> 01:02:10,580
Number 41. Get your head
in the fucking game.

1173
01:02:10,647 --> 01:02:11,915
Come on, Brandon.
Let's go!

1174
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:14,584
Push up!

1175
01:02:14,651 --> 01:02:15,585
Defense!

1176
01:02:15,652 --> 01:02:18,089
All right.
Motion, motion, motion.

1177
01:02:18,156 --> 01:02:19,790
Don't stop.

1178
01:02:19,856 --> 01:02:22,526
41's the shooter.
Watch the drop screen.

1179
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:30,801
Push it up. Let's go!

1180
01:02:32,269 --> 01:02:33,470
Look out.

1181
01:02:34,172 --> 01:02:35,505
Kenny!

1182
01:02:35,572 --> 01:02:37,240
Playing with their heads up
their fucking ass.

1183
01:02:37,307 --> 01:02:39,476
They're just really nervous
right now.

1184
01:02:39,543 --> 01:02:42,279
These guys have never played
a game that's ever mattered.

1185
01:02:42,345 --> 01:02:44,414
One stop. No threes.

1186
01:02:45,682 --> 01:02:47,250
Shit.

1187
01:02:51,055 --> 01:02:53,490
- Switch up, switch up.
- Defense!

1188
01:02:53,557 --> 01:02:55,392
- Move! Move!
- Defense!

1189
01:02:55,459 --> 01:02:57,761
Here we go,
here we go! Go!

1190
01:02:57,828 --> 01:03:00,831
Come on, Kenny! That's stupid.
It's the back court!

1191
01:03:00,897 --> 01:03:03,101
- I know.
- Yo, commit to the top.

1192
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,668
- We had an open player.
- All right, all right. I know.

1193
01:03:04,735 --> 01:03:05,869
Let's go! 22! 22!

1194
01:03:05,936 --> 01:03:07,704
- Watch the screen!
- No threes!

1195
01:03:10,474 --> 01:03:12,442
- Any time-outs?
- None.

1196
01:03:12,509 --> 01:03:13,844
Push it, push it!

1197
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:14,878
Get through,
get through, get through.

1198
01:03:14,945 --> 01:03:16,047
Hayes, look up.

1199
01:03:19,516 --> 01:03:21,986
Oh, that's bullshit.

1200
01:03:22,053 --> 01:03:23,587
What's the call, Sal?

1201
01:03:23,653 --> 01:03:25,589
Offensive foul,
number 23.

1202
01:03:25,655 --> 01:03:27,290
That's bullshit.
He was moving his feet!

1203
01:03:27,357 --> 01:03:28,960
- Offensive, number 23.
- He was moving his feet.

1204
01:03:29,026 --> 01:03:30,594
He was already set, Jack.

1205
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:32,462
You don't make that fucking
call at the end of the game!

1206
01:03:32,529 --> 01:03:34,232
- It's the end of the game!
- His feet were set, Jack!

1207
01:03:34,297 --> 01:03:36,266
It's a chickenshit call.

1208
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:37,934
- Come on. That's a pussy call.
- Listen, that's a warning.

1209
01:03:38,002 --> 01:03:39,469
And you're a fucking pussy
for making it.

1210
01:03:39,536 --> 01:03:40,337
All right, you know what?
That's it.

1211
01:03:40,403 --> 01:03:41,404
Fuck you.

1212
01:03:41,471 --> 01:03:42,672
Hey, Jack. Jack!

1213
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:43,975
Technical foul,
right here.

1214
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:45,909
You don't fucking
decide the game! Okay?

1215
01:03:45,977 --> 01:03:48,179
The players
decide the fucking game.

1216
01:03:48,246 --> 01:03:50,148
- That's bullshit.
- Jack, Jack, Jack.

1217
01:03:50,214 --> 01:03:51,615
You don't
fucking do that now!

1218
01:03:51,681 --> 01:03:53,550
The players
decide the goddamn game!

1219
01:03:53,617 --> 01:03:55,619
- Hey!
- You've gotta calm down.

1220
01:03:55,685 --> 01:03:58,222
Technical foul.
You're outta here.

1221
01:03:58,288 --> 01:04:00,024
<i>♪ Na na na na ♪</i>

1222
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:03,426
<i>♪ Na na na na
Hey hey, goodbye ♪</i>

1223
01:04:03,493 --> 01:04:05,796
Take a breath.

1224
01:04:05,862 --> 01:04:09,499
<i>♪ Na na na
na Na na na na ♪</i>

1225
01:04:09,566 --> 01:04:13,470
<i>♪ Hey hey, goodbye ♪</i>

1226
01:04:28,485 --> 01:04:30,554
Sorry for
losing my temper tonight.

1227
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:34,858
I shouldn't have done that.

1228
01:04:38,662 --> 01:04:41,098
You know what my dad told me
last night?

1229
01:04:41,165 --> 01:04:43,567
He said that you got
a full ride to Kansas

1230
01:04:44,467 --> 01:04:47,038
and that you just quit.

1231
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:48,905
No reason.

1232
01:04:53,777 --> 01:04:54,778
Why?

1233
01:05:04,387 --> 01:05:06,656
My father didn't like me
very much.

1234
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:11,761
And then someone told him
I was good at basketball

1235
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:13,998
and he paid
a lot more attention to me.

1236
01:05:15,665 --> 01:05:18,869
And the better I got,
the more love he showed me.

1237
01:05:20,804 --> 01:05:23,373
Then I realized
it wasn't me that he loved...

1238
01:05:25,243 --> 01:05:26,978
it was what I could do.

1239
01:05:30,014 --> 01:05:32,449
So, you just quit playing
as a "fuck you" to your dad?

1240
01:05:35,186 --> 01:05:37,088
Yeah, I guess so.

1241
01:05:38,488 --> 01:05:40,557
I made a lot of bad decisions,
Brandon.

1242
01:05:40,624 --> 01:05:42,093
I got a lot of regret.

1243
01:05:43,261 --> 01:05:44,594
Went away from basketball,

1244
01:05:44,661 --> 01:05:46,830
got into a different life,
got into drugs.

1245
01:05:48,966 --> 01:05:50,968
Spent a lot of time
hurting myself,

1246
01:05:51,035 --> 01:05:52,602
trying to hurt my father.

1247
01:06:00,777 --> 01:06:02,779
It was my wife
who got me outta that.

1248
01:06:10,121 --> 01:06:12,489
I never picked up
a basketball again.

1249
01:06:25,069 --> 01:06:27,171
Yeah, go ahead
and lower it in.

1250
01:06:28,505 --> 01:06:30,975
Russ! Yo, Russ!

1251
01:06:31,042 --> 01:06:32,310
You got a visitor.

1252
01:06:32,376 --> 01:06:34,444
Yo! Dump that. Dump it!

1253
01:06:35,745 --> 01:06:36,846
Let's go! All right. Back.

1254
01:06:36,913 --> 01:06:38,182
Excuse me,
are you Russ Durrett?

1255
01:06:38,249 --> 01:06:39,250
Yeah, can I help you?

1256
01:06:39,317 --> 01:06:40,583
Yeah, I'm Jack Cunningham.

1257
01:06:40,650 --> 01:06:41,751
I coach your son
over at Bishop Hayes.

1258
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:43,620
Get this tuna
on the scale now.

1259
01:06:43,687 --> 01:06:45,990
Yeah, man, I know who you are.

1260
01:06:46,057 --> 01:06:49,026
Yeah, I used to come watch you
play down at Cheviot Hills.

1261
01:06:49,093 --> 01:06:52,063
You and Benny Green
and YaYa Davis.

1262
01:06:52,129 --> 01:06:55,166
Yeah, man. YaYa and Benny,
man, we used to do our thing.

1263
01:06:55,232 --> 01:06:56,700
So, how can I help you?

1264
01:06:56,766 --> 01:06:58,601
Well, I want to talk
to you about Brandon.

1265
01:06:58,668 --> 01:06:59,971
Has he shown you any of

1266
01:07:00,037 --> 01:07:01,405
the recruiting letters
he's been getting?

1267
01:07:01,471 --> 01:07:03,074
Brandon ain't
shown me nothing.

1268
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:05,809
Well, he's getting a lot of
attention from good schools

1269
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:07,610
that want him
to come play ball for 'em.

1270
01:07:07,677 --> 01:07:09,779
Thanks for coming by here
and letting me know,

1271
01:07:10,247 --> 01:07:12,615
Coach.

1272
01:07:12,682 --> 01:07:14,617
How come we don't see you
down at any of the games?

1273
01:07:14,684 --> 01:07:16,486
'Cause I got responsibilities
at home.

1274
01:07:16,553 --> 01:07:18,055
I got two boys
that need to be bathed,

1275
01:07:18,122 --> 01:07:19,622
fed, and helped
with their homework.

1276
01:07:19,689 --> 01:07:21,524
Well, we got a big game
this week.

1277
01:07:21,591 --> 01:07:23,995
If we win it,
we go to the playoffs.

1278
01:07:24,061 --> 01:07:26,596
Listen, I don't come
to any games

1279
01:07:26,663 --> 01:07:28,432
'cause I don't support
my son's ideas

1280
01:07:28,498 --> 01:07:30,101
about the game, okay?

1281
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:32,669
I don't want him relying on
basketball to make a life.

1282
01:07:32,736 --> 01:07:35,839
That was my mistake
and it ain't gonna be his.

1283
01:07:35,905 --> 01:07:37,907
These schools are offering him
full scholarships.

1284
01:07:37,975 --> 01:07:40,244
Oh, come on, man.
It don't matter.

1285
01:07:40,311 --> 01:07:42,013
They offered me the same.

1286
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,447
Putting your faith
in basketball,

1287
01:07:43,513 --> 01:07:45,016
it don't work out.

1288
01:07:45,082 --> 01:07:46,783
And if anybody ought to
know that, it oughta be you.

1289
01:07:49,453 --> 01:07:50,653
Yeah.

1290
01:07:53,024 --> 01:07:55,525
Your son loves the game.
He's gonna keep playing it.

1291
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:09,440
Let's do this!

1292
01:08:09,507 --> 01:08:12,443
Let's go Bishop!
Whoo! Let's go!

1293
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:16,247
It's the Tigers, baby!
Let's do this, Hayes!

1294
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,602
Um... So, are we gonna stay

1295
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:41,272
in the press
the whole game or...

1296
01:08:41,338 --> 01:08:42,605
Yep, right from the tip.

1297
01:08:42,672 --> 01:08:45,242
Okay.
I'd better get the lineup

1298
01:08:45,309 --> 01:08:46,843
out to the scores table.

1299
01:08:47,445 --> 01:08:49,447
And, uh...

1300
01:08:49,513 --> 01:08:51,714
I know nobody expected us
to be here

1301
01:08:51,781 --> 01:08:53,984
and we got no business
winning this game,

1302
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:57,221
but I really want
to beat these fucking guys.

1303
01:09:20,610 --> 01:09:22,812
Come on,
Coach Cunningham!

1304
01:09:24,014 --> 01:09:26,283
We love you, Coach!

1305
01:09:33,656 --> 01:09:35,059
- All right.
- Let's fly.

1306
01:09:39,330 --> 01:09:40,331
Coach.

1307
01:09:43,534 --> 01:09:45,768
Let's go. Bring it in.

1308
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:51,908
All right.

1309
01:09:51,976 --> 01:09:53,877
We're on Diamond press
right from the tip.

1310
01:09:53,943 --> 01:09:55,146
Keep that pressure up.

1311
01:09:55,212 --> 01:09:57,348
They break it,
fall back into 22.

1312
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:02,520
Look, you're nervous.

1313
01:10:02,586 --> 01:10:03,786
I get that.

1314
01:10:03,853 --> 01:10:05,189
The truth is,

1315
01:10:05,256 --> 01:10:07,958
they got more talent
over there than we do.

1316
01:10:08,025 --> 01:10:09,627
Probably got a better coach.

1317
01:10:09,692 --> 01:10:11,028
Nah.

1318
01:10:11,095 --> 01:10:15,032
But I promise you,
they are not a better team.

1319
01:10:15,099 --> 01:10:17,468
I would take anyone
on this bench right now,

1320
01:10:17,535 --> 01:10:19,370
for any one of those players.

1321
01:10:19,436 --> 01:10:22,406
You worked hard to be here,
you earned this.

1322
01:10:22,473 --> 01:10:23,840
Have some fun out there.

1323
01:10:23,907 --> 01:10:25,609
Now go out there
and earn the playoffs.

1324
01:10:25,708 --> 01:10:27,278
All right, do it!

1325
01:10:27,344 --> 01:10:29,613
Win on three.
One, two, three...

1326
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:30,713
Win!

1327
01:10:43,093 --> 01:10:44,361
Up! Up!

1328
01:10:44,428 --> 01:10:46,130
- Get your man.
- Hands up, hands up!

1329
01:10:47,498 --> 01:10:49,633
Gonna eat us alive,
if we give that shot.

1330
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:50,968
Push him to his left.

1331
01:10:51,035 --> 01:10:52,436
Atlanta high,
Atlanta high.

1332
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:53,337
Quick, quick!
Switch, switch, switch!

1333
01:10:54,938 --> 01:10:56,140
Get back, get back!

1334
01:10:58,209 --> 01:10:59,410
That's it.

1335
01:11:01,111 --> 01:11:02,946
Box out!
Watch it! Watch it!

1336
01:11:03,746 --> 01:11:06,116
Rebound!

1337
01:11:06,183 --> 01:11:08,319
Switch up. Come down,
come down, come down!

1338
01:11:08,385 --> 01:11:09,886
- Corner, corner, corner.
- Hey!

1339
01:11:09,954 --> 01:11:11,155
Go, go, go!

1340
01:11:18,761 --> 01:11:19,997
Help out!

1341
01:11:24,468 --> 01:11:25,703
Time-out, time-out.

1342
01:11:25,768 --> 01:11:27,737
Get up and yell "Bishop!"

1343
01:11:27,804 --> 01:11:28,871
We need stops.

1344
01:11:28,938 --> 01:11:30,207
So let's double-team Childress

1345
01:11:30,274 --> 01:11:32,076
every time he comes across
half-court.

1346
01:11:32,142 --> 01:11:34,044
Make somebody else
fucking score.

1347
01:11:34,111 --> 01:11:36,746
Stay on him! Press!
Pressure! Don't give up!

1348
01:11:36,813 --> 01:11:38,115
Watch the pick.

1349
01:11:38,182 --> 01:11:39,516
Pick left.
Switch off to the side.

1350
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:40,584
Go! Let's go.

1351
01:11:40,651 --> 01:11:41,918
Throw it in!

1352
01:11:43,254 --> 01:11:45,922
That's it! That's it!
Here we go, here we go.

1353
01:11:48,025 --> 01:11:50,527
- Put it in there.
- Go on, go on!

1354
01:11:50,594 --> 01:11:53,097
You guys gotta move.
You can't stand around.

1355
01:11:53,163 --> 01:11:54,398
Switch, switch,
switch, switch, switch.

1356
01:11:58,369 --> 01:12:00,104
Let's go.
Bring it through.

1357
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:02,206
- Here we go!
- Pick him up. Pick him up.

1358
01:12:02,273 --> 01:12:04,708
Look, we're not gonna make it
all back in one possession.

1359
01:12:04,774 --> 01:12:07,011
You gotta just keep chipping
away, and chipping away at it.

1360
01:12:07,077 --> 01:12:08,379
Watch him, watch him.
Down the rail.

1361
01:12:08,445 --> 01:12:09,912
- Up!
- Come on. Come on.

1362
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:12,283
Little things,
do the little things.

1363
01:12:12,349 --> 01:12:14,151
Take it to the rack.
That's you.

1364
01:12:14,218 --> 01:12:15,653
Let's go, baby. Let's go, huh!

1365
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:17,321
Let's go, son.

1366
01:12:17,388 --> 01:12:19,390
Yeah!

1367
01:12:19,456 --> 01:12:22,892
There you go.
All right. Up, up, up!

1368
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,228
- D-up, D-up.
- Let's go.

1369
01:12:24,295 --> 01:12:25,862
Get your man,
get your man.

1370
01:12:25,928 --> 01:12:27,364
Get up in their faces.
Get in their face.

1371
01:12:27,431 --> 01:12:28,798
Bobby, Bobby,
watch this guy. Watch this...

1372
01:12:28,865 --> 01:12:29,866
Let's get a trap!

1373
01:12:29,932 --> 01:12:31,135
Pass it.

1374
01:12:32,303 --> 01:12:34,505
Yeah! There you go!

1375
01:12:34,571 --> 01:12:37,374
Too easy.
That's too easy.

1376
01:12:37,441 --> 01:12:39,576
Switch, switch.
Get through it.

1377
01:12:40,843 --> 01:12:42,212
Motion, motion.

1378
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:43,647
Here you go,
here you go, here you go.

1379
01:12:43,714 --> 01:12:45,482
Hey, coming through,
coming through.

1380
01:12:45,549 --> 01:12:46,883
Pick left, pick left.
Go through, go through.

1381
01:12:46,949 --> 01:12:48,786
Nice pass.

1382
01:12:48,851 --> 01:12:50,087
Time-out! Time-out.

1383
01:12:50,154 --> 01:12:52,523
Keep pressing, trapping,
taking charges.

1384
01:12:52,589 --> 01:12:54,692
Make our lack of size
an advantage.

1385
01:12:54,758 --> 01:12:55,892
Play like
we've got a fucking chip

1386
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:57,127
on our shoulders. Let's go!

1387
01:12:57,194 --> 01:12:58,895
Go, go, go. Lock up.

1388
01:12:58,962 --> 01:13:00,631
Oh! Offensive!

1389
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:01,765
- Offensive.
- Yeah!

1390
01:13:01,831 --> 01:13:03,367
Come on!

1391
01:13:03,434 --> 01:13:05,769
Jesus, you guys. We're playing
right into their hands.

1392
01:13:05,835 --> 01:13:08,605
Move the ball.
Move the ball.

1393
01:13:08,672 --> 01:13:09,906
Let's go!

1394
01:13:12,009 --> 01:13:13,777
Diamond, Diamond, Diamond!

1395
01:13:13,843 --> 01:13:16,280
Zach, he's six inches
shorter than you.

1396
01:13:16,347 --> 01:13:17,847
How does he make that shot?

1397
01:13:17,914 --> 01:13:19,949
Chips on our
fucking shoulders. Let's go!

1398
01:13:20,017 --> 01:13:21,352
That!

1399
01:13:21,418 --> 01:13:23,053
- Defense!
- Stay on your man.

1400
01:13:24,421 --> 01:13:26,123
That's it. Beautiful.

1401
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,924
I don't even know
who I'm looking at.

1402
01:13:27,991 --> 01:13:30,694
Go, go, go.

1403
01:13:30,761 --> 01:13:31,762
Out!

1404
01:13:31,829 --> 01:13:32,996
Ran out. You ran out.

1405
01:13:33,063 --> 01:13:34,864
Get him, get him.

1406
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:37,735
- Hey, Diamond! Diamond!
- D-up!

1407
01:13:37,801 --> 01:13:38,935
- Pressure!
- Come on,

1408
01:13:39,002 --> 01:13:40,070
- break through.
- Pressure!

1409
01:13:40,137 --> 01:13:41,338
Reach. Shoot.

1410
01:13:43,173 --> 01:13:46,977
Attack this.
Attack their pressure!

1411
01:13:47,044 --> 01:13:51,115
Switch, switch, switch.
Come on! Box out.

1412
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:53,851
Twenty-two.
Plot it out! Plot it out!

1413
01:13:56,253 --> 01:13:59,922
That's it, that's it,
that's it. That's it!

1414
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:01,191
Yeah, that's a great call.

1415
01:14:01,258 --> 01:14:02,393
That is a bullshit call.

1416
01:14:02,459 --> 01:14:04,128
How many time-outs
do we have?

1417
01:14:04,194 --> 01:14:05,529
- One time-out left.
- His hands were all over 'em.

1418
01:14:05,596 --> 01:14:07,064
- It's a home job.
- All right. Time-out!

1419
01:14:08,432 --> 01:14:09,833
Time-out.

1420
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:11,301
All right.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

1421
01:14:13,437 --> 01:14:15,439
- What's up? Say something.
- Hey, hey, hey. Chill. Chill.

1422
01:14:15,506 --> 01:14:17,107
- Bring it in.
- Chill, man. Come on.

1423
01:14:17,174 --> 01:14:18,375
What're you gonna do?

1424
01:14:18,442 --> 01:14:19,710
I'm gonna run Atlanta
for Brandon.

1425
01:14:19,777 --> 01:14:21,011
But Childress is on him.

1426
01:14:21,078 --> 01:14:22,379
You gotta expect
a double-team.

1427
01:14:22,446 --> 01:14:25,048
So, is he gonna get
an open look?

1428
01:14:25,115 --> 01:14:26,350
Yeah.

1429
01:14:27,317 --> 01:14:31,088
All right.
12 seconds, no time-outs.

1430
01:14:32,122 --> 01:14:34,158
We're gonna run the Hawk
for Kenny.

1431
01:14:34,224 --> 01:14:35,659
Marcus, set the high pick.

1432
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:37,561
Freeze, Garcia, come round,
set a double screen.

1433
01:14:37,628 --> 01:14:39,863
Brandon, go right,
look for Kenny on the wing.

1434
01:14:39,929 --> 01:14:41,298
Three, we're stopping three.

1435
01:14:41,365 --> 01:14:43,534
He gets the ball,
he doesn't go five feet.

1436
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,868
We lock him up. One stop.

1437
01:14:44,934 --> 01:14:46,770
Stay focused,
run our set.

1438
01:14:46,837 --> 01:14:48,005
Get out there and win this.

1439
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:51,975
- Team on three.
- Win on three.

1440
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:53,143
One, two, three...

1441
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:54,378
Win!

1442
01:14:54,445 --> 01:14:55,579
Let's go, man!
Let's do this.

1443
01:14:59,483 --> 01:15:00,851
Brandon...

1444
01:15:00,918 --> 01:15:03,253
Forget that.
Take the shot.

1445
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:04,955
Don't nod your head at me.

1446
01:15:05,022 --> 01:15:06,223
I got this.

1447
01:18:20,051 --> 01:18:21,318
Hello?

1448
01:18:21,385 --> 01:18:23,153
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

1449
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:24,721
Hey.

1450
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:28,158
<i>I just got off the phone
with Miguel, and...</i>

1451
01:18:29,093 --> 01:18:30,260
What?

1452
01:18:55,552 --> 01:18:57,521
- Hey.
- Hey.

1453
01:18:59,057 --> 01:19:00,891
What happened?

1454
01:19:00,958 --> 01:19:02,459
A few weeks ago,
he was hitting baseballs.

1455
01:19:02,526 --> 01:19:06,030
Yeah, he, um...
He had a fever at school.

1456
01:19:06,097 --> 01:19:09,433
Sofia picked him up, and
then he just started seizing.

1457
01:19:11,268 --> 01:19:13,137
Is he conscious?

1458
01:19:13,203 --> 01:19:14,838
He's sedated.

1459
01:19:21,378 --> 01:19:23,081
Is he, uh,

1460
01:19:23,147 --> 01:19:24,381
gonna be okay, or...

1461
01:19:24,448 --> 01:19:26,216
They don't know.

1462
01:19:27,051 --> 01:19:28,285
They did a scan this morning,

1463
01:19:28,351 --> 01:19:30,353
they're just waiting
on results now.

1464
01:19:44,102 --> 01:19:45,103
No!

1465
01:19:45,169 --> 01:19:48,672
No! No!

1466
01:20:04,354 --> 01:20:06,023
I can't. I... I gotta go.

1467
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,624
Just wait.

1468
01:20:07,691 --> 01:20:08,925
- Where are you going?
- I gotta go. I gotta go.

1469
01:21:56,399 --> 01:21:58,802
Come on. Come on.

1470
01:21:58,869 --> 01:22:00,537
Just a few more.

1471
01:22:00,604 --> 01:22:02,240
You should see my moves.

1472
01:22:02,306 --> 01:22:03,607
They're better
than my old man.

1473
01:22:03,673 --> 01:22:06,476
Your old man
didn't have moves.

1474
01:22:06,543 --> 01:22:08,578
I used to carry him
up the stairs.

1475
01:22:08,645 --> 01:22:10,680
Got the key? Huh?

1476
01:22:11,381 --> 01:22:12,549
Let's go.

1477
01:22:12,616 --> 01:22:15,219
No. No, no, no.

1478
01:22:15,286 --> 01:22:16,887
Give it here.

1479
01:22:17,955 --> 01:22:19,656
There you go.

1480
01:22:39,310 --> 01:22:41,611
<i>Look at Marcus!</i>

1481
01:22:41,678 --> 01:22:43,047
<i>Come on, man,
I'm right here!</i>

1482
01:22:43,114 --> 01:22:44,814
<i>Let's see
the ball move, okay?</i>

1483
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:48,352
- Double back to me.
- Go, go, go!

1484
01:22:48,418 --> 01:22:49,653
Snap it back through!

1485
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:51,888
Nice, Sam.

1486
01:22:54,325 --> 01:22:55,692
Call 'em out! Call 'em out!

1487
01:23:32,029 --> 01:23:34,564
Get through, get through.

1488
01:23:34,631 --> 01:23:35,665
Come on, get through,
get through.

1489
01:23:35,732 --> 01:23:37,201
Nice, Kenny.

1490
01:23:40,037 --> 01:23:42,139
- Come on.
- Come on.

1491
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,808
- Hey, Jack.
- Coach.

1492
01:23:44,874 --> 01:23:46,344
Are you all right?
Where you been?

1493
01:23:46,410 --> 01:23:49,612
Yeah. Had a power outage
in my, uh,

1494
01:23:50,214 --> 01:23:51,648
neighborhood.

1495
01:23:51,715 --> 01:23:53,650
Alarm didn't go off so...

1496
01:23:53,717 --> 01:23:56,120
I overslept.
I apologize.

1497
01:23:56,187 --> 01:23:58,255
Bring it in.

1498
01:23:59,656 --> 01:24:02,592
I had a power situation
at my place.

1499
01:24:02,659 --> 01:24:06,430
I overslept.
That's on me, okay?

1500
01:24:06,496 --> 01:24:08,065
Let's get into a Hawk set.

1501
01:24:08,132 --> 01:24:11,534
Brandon, take the ball.
Kenny and Garcia on the wing.

1502
01:24:11,601 --> 01:24:13,270
Marcus and Freeze,
start in the box.

1503
01:24:58,215 --> 01:24:59,216
Yeah.

1504
01:25:01,986 --> 01:25:04,455
Hey, Padre.
How's it going?

1505
01:25:04,522 --> 01:25:06,524
How are you, Jack?

1506
01:25:06,589 --> 01:25:08,558
I'm all right.
What can I do for ya?

1507
01:25:10,727 --> 01:25:12,530
Jack, I'm afraid
we're gonna have to ask you

1508
01:25:12,595 --> 01:25:15,166
to step down
from coaching the team.

1509
01:25:19,203 --> 01:25:20,204
Why?

1510
01:25:21,771 --> 01:25:23,706
It's come to my attention

1511
01:25:23,773 --> 01:25:26,776
that you've brought alcohol
around the players.

1512
01:25:26,843 --> 01:25:28,745
We're gonna have to
let you go.

1513
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:32,049
And I'm gonna need
your office key.

1514
01:25:33,484 --> 01:25:34,651
I'm worried that this might be

1515
01:25:34,717 --> 01:25:36,353
part of a larger problem,
Jack.

1516
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:37,654
Would that be true?

1517
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:39,223
You didn't want to
just come talk to me?

1518
01:25:39,290 --> 01:25:40,958
I did come talk to you
about it, Jack,

1519
01:25:41,025 --> 01:25:42,259
- and then you lied to me.
- I never lied to you.

1520
01:25:42,326 --> 01:25:43,893
I didn't lie to you
about anything.

1521
01:25:43,961 --> 01:25:45,329
You lied to me today
about your alarm clock.

1522
01:25:45,396 --> 01:25:47,897
I had
a power outage at my house.

1523
01:25:47,965 --> 01:25:49,833
- You were drunk at practice.
- Oh, bullshit!

1524
01:25:49,899 --> 01:25:51,302
- I could smell it on you.
- Bullshit.

1525
01:25:51,368 --> 01:25:53,603
The boys
could smell it on you.

1526
01:26:05,382 --> 01:26:06,683
Uh...

1527
01:26:10,254 --> 01:26:11,888
All right, look...

1528
01:26:13,991 --> 01:26:16,826
Let's just get
to the playoffs, all right?

1529
01:26:16,893 --> 01:26:22,166
Guys, please.
Just don't do this. Okay?

1530
01:26:22,233 --> 01:26:25,035
I had a bad night. And,
I got it under control now

1531
01:26:25,102 --> 01:26:26,604
and I can take care of it.

1532
01:26:26,669 --> 01:26:29,639
Let's just, please...
I'm asking you, please, okay?

1533
01:26:29,706 --> 01:26:32,977
I'm sorry.
Please, don't do it, do this.

1534
01:26:33,043 --> 01:26:36,746
Jack, you've made
this decision for me.

1535
01:26:38,149 --> 01:26:40,417
I can't accept responsibility

1536
01:26:40,484 --> 01:26:43,686
for allowing you to be
around the boys anymore.

1537
01:27:02,339 --> 01:27:03,673
You know...

1538
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:05,309
Fine.

1539
01:27:07,511 --> 01:27:09,113
Look, please, just...

1540
01:27:10,981 --> 01:27:12,349
Please, don't do this.

1541
01:27:12,416 --> 01:27:14,185
Our decision is final, Jack.

1542
01:27:14,251 --> 01:27:15,885
We have
a zero-tolerance policy

1543
01:27:15,953 --> 01:27:18,189
- when it comes to alcohol.
- Fine. Fuck it.

1544
01:27:18,255 --> 01:27:20,857
I tried to do something good
with these kids.

1545
01:27:20,924 --> 01:27:23,527
You know...

1546
01:27:23,594 --> 01:27:25,496
It's your choice.

1547
01:27:25,563 --> 01:27:26,796
Who's gonna coach the team?

1548
01:27:26,863 --> 01:27:29,366
You? You're a fucking
math teacher.

1549
01:27:29,433 --> 01:27:32,236
I came to help you out.
Look what we did.

1550
01:27:32,303 --> 01:27:34,338
Tried to come in here
and help you.

1551
01:27:34,405 --> 01:27:36,273
You asked for my help.

1552
01:27:36,340 --> 01:27:39,842
And I tried to help you.
This is such bullshit.

1553
01:27:39,909 --> 01:27:41,011
I can't get this fucking...

1554
01:27:41,078 --> 01:27:42,479
I don't need this job.

1555
01:27:42,546 --> 01:27:43,947
We are trying to help, Jack.

1556
01:27:44,014 --> 01:27:45,082
You know what? Stick...

1557
01:28:59,490 --> 01:29:00,491
What's this?

1558
01:29:01,791 --> 01:29:03,494
From the blonde in the corner.

1559
01:29:04,395 --> 01:29:05,928
Says she knows you.

1560
01:29:32,323 --> 01:29:35,092
Another one
from the blonde in the corner.

1561
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:38,028
Only this time it comes
with a message...

1562
01:29:38,095 --> 01:29:41,864
"Stop being a jerk-off
and come over and talk to me."

1563
01:29:44,001 --> 01:29:45,169
I think it's one of
the Pearson girls

1564
01:29:45,235 --> 01:29:46,570
from Saint Dorothy's.

1565
01:29:48,772 --> 01:29:50,274
Yeah, I think it's Diane.

1566
01:29:58,948 --> 01:30:00,883
I paid for you.
I paid for the whole bar.

1567
01:30:00,951 --> 01:30:03,053
You didn't pay for me.

1568
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:04,588
I mean, if everybody...

1569
01:30:04,655 --> 01:30:06,923
Here, give me...
Can I have a drag of that?

1570
01:30:06,990 --> 01:30:08,959
- Mmm.
- Please?

1571
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:10,961
God.

1572
01:30:13,097 --> 01:30:16,133
Thank you. You know,
I'll tell you a secret.

1573
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:17,401
- What?
- Give me a kiss.

1574
01:30:17,468 --> 01:30:18,868
No. You're driving.
No. Fuck off.

1575
01:30:18,935 --> 01:30:20,170
Yes, I am driving.
Give me a kiss.

1576
01:30:20,237 --> 01:30:21,238
Okay, just one.
Just one. Just one.

1577
01:30:21,305 --> 01:30:22,172
It's one kiss. My, God.

1578
01:30:29,912 --> 01:30:31,181
Shit.

1579
01:30:31,248 --> 01:30:32,915
Oh, God!

1580
01:30:32,983 --> 01:30:35,285
Oh, shit. Shit!

1581
01:30:35,352 --> 01:30:37,020
- This is my neighbor's house.
- What?

1582
01:30:37,087 --> 01:30:38,555
You've gotta go
round the back.

1583
01:30:38,622 --> 01:30:39,857
- Hurry up! Just go round the back...
- All right.

1584
01:30:39,922 --> 01:30:41,125
I'll meet you there.

1585
01:30:41,191 --> 01:30:42,359
It's the third house
on the right.

1586
01:31:22,666 --> 01:31:23,933
Hello?

1587
01:31:26,403 --> 01:31:29,139
Forget to pay
the electricity bill?

1588
01:31:44,221 --> 01:31:48,459
I think we made it.
Think we're safe.

1589
01:31:48,525 --> 01:31:52,095
Somebody's gonna come out
for a fucking surprise,

1590
01:31:52,162 --> 01:31:54,965
check their mailbox
in the morning,

1591
01:31:55,032 --> 01:31:56,567
find out their boat's
fucking

1592
01:31:57,801 --> 01:31:59,336
sunk.

1593
01:32:13,217 --> 01:32:15,452
Pull your fucking pants up.

1594
01:32:15,519 --> 01:32:17,321
My wife's calling the cops
right now, asshole.

1595
01:32:17,387 --> 01:32:18,856
Yes, my husband's
speaking with him now.

1596
01:32:18,922 --> 01:32:20,657
Diane's your wife?

1597
01:32:20,724 --> 01:32:22,125
Who the fuck is Diane?

1598
01:32:23,026 --> 01:32:24,194
I don't know.

1599
01:32:24,995 --> 01:32:26,196
Who's...

1600
01:32:27,764 --> 01:32:29,199
I'm in the wrong house, man.

1601
01:32:29,266 --> 01:32:31,401
Oh, you're goddamn right,
you're in the wrong house.

1602
01:32:31,468 --> 01:32:32,603
Look, I'm sorry.

1603
01:32:34,304 --> 01:32:36,406
I'm real sorry.
I'm just gonna go home.

1604
01:32:36,473 --> 01:32:37,808
Nah, you're not
going anywhere.

1605
01:32:37,875 --> 01:32:39,510
Sit down. Wait for the cops.

1606
01:32:39,576 --> 01:32:41,980
Come on, sit down.
Sit down!

1607
01:32:42,613 --> 01:32:43,847
Hey!

1608
01:33:44,976 --> 01:33:46,176
Okay?

1609
01:33:53,183 --> 01:33:54,384
Can I get you anything?

1610
01:34:01,993 --> 01:34:03,460
Did they tell you

1611
01:34:03,527 --> 01:34:05,596
that they found you
unconscious in the street?

1612
01:34:08,198 --> 01:34:11,234
And that you broke
into someone's house?

1613
01:34:14,605 --> 01:34:15,672
Yeah.

1614
01:34:27,517 --> 01:34:28,852
Just...

1615
01:34:28,919 --> 01:34:30,721
You're gonna kill yourself
if you keep going like this.

1616
01:34:34,424 --> 01:34:36,760
That's why I'm gonna
get you some help, okay?

1617
01:34:40,364 --> 01:34:42,733
It has been decided
that he will no longer

1618
01:34:42,799 --> 01:34:44,102
be with the team

1619
01:34:44,167 --> 01:34:47,105
due to personal issues
that we'd rather not go into.

1620
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:51,009
I will step in
as the interim coach.

1621
01:34:51,075 --> 01:34:52,309
And I don't see why...

1622
01:34:52,376 --> 01:34:53,543
<i>During our family session...</i>

1623
01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:55,079
...anything has to change.

1624
01:34:55,145 --> 01:34:56,680
<i>...your sister
and mother said that</i>

1625
01:34:56,747 --> 01:34:58,415
you've isolated yourself
since Michael died.

1626
01:34:59,984 --> 01:35:02,619
Would you agree with them?

1627
01:35:02,686 --> 01:35:05,089
Yeah. I mean,
I certainly don't see them

1628
01:35:05,155 --> 01:35:06,523
as much as I used to.

1629
01:35:08,026 --> 01:35:10,594
They also said you never talk
about your son.

1630
01:35:22,873 --> 01:35:24,775
I don't know
what they want me to say.

1631
01:35:28,345 --> 01:35:30,847
I could talk about the, uh,

1632
01:35:30,914 --> 01:35:33,951
tumors in his brain
and his spine.

1633
01:35:36,620 --> 01:35:39,389
Thirty rounds of radiation.

1634
01:35:42,192 --> 01:35:44,594
He used to scream
when he had seizures.

1635
01:35:49,299 --> 01:35:50,867
Nobody wants to hear that.

1636
01:35:57,340 --> 01:35:59,576
We can't change
the past, Jack.

1637
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:05,983
What we can do is choose
how we move forward.

1638
01:36:09,853 --> 01:36:10,921
Think about Michael.

1639
01:36:14,424 --> 01:36:16,293
What would he want for you?

1640
01:36:51,928 --> 01:36:52,929
Hi.

1641
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:54,731
Hey.

1642
01:36:57,567 --> 01:36:59,536
Thanks for coming.

1643
01:36:59,603 --> 01:37:01,404
Can I take your coat?

1644
01:37:06,210 --> 01:37:07,844
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

1645
01:37:13,017 --> 01:37:14,018
How's it going?

1646
01:37:14,851 --> 01:37:16,988
Good. Good.

1647
01:37:17,054 --> 01:37:20,390
Good. I'm really glad
you're here, Jack.

1648
01:37:20,457 --> 01:37:22,826
Yeah. Me too.

1649
01:37:24,761 --> 01:37:27,297
I shoulda come here
a long time ago.

1650
01:37:29,733 --> 01:37:32,069
I just want you
to know that, uh,

1651
01:37:33,937 --> 01:37:35,839
I know that I failed you.

1652
01:37:37,507 --> 01:37:39,709
And I know
that I failed our marriage.

1653
01:37:44,314 --> 01:37:45,916
I failed our son

1654
01:37:50,054 --> 01:37:52,322
'cause I didn't take care
of his mom.

1655
01:37:57,995 --> 01:37:59,696
And I hope that, uh,

1656
01:38:00,564 --> 01:38:03,333
one day you can see in me

1657
01:38:04,467 --> 01:38:06,903
the man that, uh,

1658
01:38:08,572 --> 01:38:11,908
that you once hoped
I would be.

1659
01:38:19,951 --> 01:38:21,685
I'm so sorry.

1660
01:39:37,928 --> 01:39:39,163
Hello?

1661
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:42,133
Hey, Dan.
How you doing?

1662
01:39:42,666 --> 01:39:44,302
It's, uh...

1663
01:39:44,368 --> 01:39:45,568
It's Jack.

1664
01:39:48,438 --> 01:39:49,706
Heavenly Father,

1665
01:39:49,773 --> 01:39:51,342
we welcome your presence here

1666
01:39:51,409 --> 01:39:52,943
among us
and your spirit of love

1667
01:39:53,010 --> 01:39:55,745
alive in the community
of Bishop Hayes.

1668
01:39:55,812 --> 01:39:58,015
Please help us
to be the best we can be.

1669
01:39:58,082 --> 01:40:02,485
To strive not so much to win,
but to play fairly and well.

1670
01:40:02,552 --> 01:40:06,190
We ask this in your name,
Lord Jesus. Amen.

1671
01:40:06,257 --> 01:40:07,724
Amen!

1672
01:40:07,791 --> 01:40:10,127
Hey, fellas, let's win
this fucking game

1673
01:40:10,194 --> 01:40:11,362
for Coach Cunningham, baby.

1674
01:40:17,034 --> 01:40:18,668
I'll talk to him.

1675
01:40:21,105 --> 01:40:22,340
Let's go.
Bring it in. Bring it in.

1676
01:40:22,406 --> 01:40:23,606
Bring it home.

1677
01:40:23,673 --> 01:40:24,908
All right, we stay in press

1678
01:40:24,976 --> 01:40:26,444
- all game, okay?
- All right.

1679
01:40:26,509 --> 01:40:27,677
Nobody gets past you.

1680
01:40:27,744 --> 01:40:28,980
You stay in their faces,
all right?

1681
01:40:29,046 --> 01:40:30,580
Play with that chip
on your shoulder,

1682
01:40:30,647 --> 01:40:31,881
stay hungry. Who are we?

1683
01:40:31,948 --> 01:40:33,184
- Hayes!
- Who are we?

1684
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:34,952
- Hayes!
- Right! Win on three.

1685
01:40:35,019 --> 01:40:36,586
Let's go.
One, two, three...

1686
01:40:36,653 --> 01:40:37,854
Win!

1687
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,848
<i>To the sharpshooter
Dawes in the corner.</i>

1688
01:41:04,914 --> 01:41:06,951
<i>He fires up a three</i>

1689
01:41:07,018 --> 01:41:08,219
<i>and it's good!</i>

1690
01:41:08,285 --> 01:41:10,488
<i>Hayes is hitting
on all cylinders tonight.</i>

1691
01:41:10,553 --> 01:41:11,921
<i>For a team that</i>

1692
01:41:11,989 --> 01:41:13,823
<i>hasn't made the playoffs
in 25 years,</i>

1693
01:41:13,890 --> 01:41:15,558
<i>they seem to be awfully
comfortable out there.</i>

1694
01:41:15,625 --> 01:41:17,495
<i>Full-court pressure
again from Hayes.</i>

1695
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:18,828
<i>Dougherty has
just not been able to</i>

1696
01:41:18,895 --> 01:41:20,331
<i>figure out the Hayes pressure.</i>

1697
01:41:20,398 --> 01:41:23,100
<i>The defense has been
absolutely suffocating.</i>

1698
01:41:23,167 --> 01:41:24,969
<i>Sanders
trapped in the corner.</i>

1699
01:41:25,036 --> 01:41:26,870
<i>He fires across the court
to Jenkins.</i>

1700
01:41:26,936 --> 01:41:28,671
<i>Pass intercepted by Durrett!</i>

1701
01:41:28,738 --> 01:41:30,740
<i>Brandon Durrett
is gonna take it by himself.</i>

1702
01:41:30,807 --> 01:41:33,144
<i>Reverse layup
and it's good!</i>

1703
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:35,346
- <i>And he's fouled!</i>
- <i>Wow!</i>

1704
01:41:35,413 --> 01:41:36,780
<i>He has been</i>

1705
01:41:36,846 --> 01:41:38,282
<i>really special today,
hasn't he, Tom?</i>

1706
01:41:38,349 --> 01:41:40,217
<i>He has been magnificent.</i>

1707
01:41:40,284 --> 01:41:43,220
<i>And now Hayes is out to its
biggest lead of the game.</i>

1708
01:41:43,287 --> 01:41:46,090
<i>We said earlier
that Coach Jack Cunningham,</i>

1709
01:41:46,157 --> 01:41:49,160
<i>the man responsible
for this amazing turnaround</i>

1710
01:41:49,226 --> 01:41:51,228
<i>wasn't able
to be on the bench today.</i>

1711
01:41:51,295 --> 01:41:54,098
<i>But you have to imagine
he'd be very proud</i>

1712
01:41:54,165 --> 01:41:56,000
<i>of the way
these boys are playing.</i>

1713
01:41:56,067 --> 01:41:57,968
<i>I can remember
watching Jack as a player.</i>

1714
01:41:58,035 --> 01:42:00,304
<i>He was tough, intense,
competitive,</i>

1715
01:42:00,371 --> 01:42:02,273
<i>and he has instilled
in these boys</i>

1716
01:42:02,339 --> 01:42:05,176
<i>all those qualities
that made him such a winner.</i>

1717
01:42:05,242 --> 01:42:07,344
<i>And you can see
Jack's imprint</i>

1718
01:42:07,411 --> 01:42:08,979
<i>all over this team.</i>

1719
01:42:09,046 --> 01:42:10,448
<i>Clearly
a reflection of their coach.</i>

1720
01:42:10,514 --> 01:42:12,016
<i>I have never seen
a high school team</i>

1721
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:13,551
<i>with this much composure.</i>

1722
01:42:37,867 --> 01:42:42,867
